# What I think about it
## Pros
- Great battery - It took about 3 moths from the first charge to discharge it completely and I we (me and my family) use it almost everyday
- It doesn't emit blue light [[KNOWLEDGE/Blue light]] - doesn't tire the eyes, it also adjust automatically to the external light.
- It is super clear, sharp and the text is visible, even when the sun is shining hard

## Cons
- Black and white - I wasn't sure if this is a pros or con because for some it might be a plus because just for reading it is more than enough but for comics and images which is more important for kids it is a big con.

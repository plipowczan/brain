# 5 minute journal
This is a concept of keeping a diary. To write few sentences every day in a structured way.

I took the concept from book [[BOOKS/Miracle morning]]

# How I do it
I modified it for my convenience.
I used to write using a paper notebook but now I do it digitally using [[TOOLS/Obsidian]] and using a template: [[templates/daily_journal]]

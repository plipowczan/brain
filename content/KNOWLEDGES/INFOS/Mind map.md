# Mind map

## 🗒️ Description
It is a note taking method for better brain engagement. When making a mind map, we engage not only the left, but also the right hemisphere of the brain, use spatial memory, build a system of associations, making it easier and faster to remember information and later reproduce it from memory.  

Creating a mind map (mind map) is to jot down a certain topic using arrows or lines connected to each other and the resulting keywords that we extract from a text or lecture. A note made in this way has a radial structure that maps a sequence of associations starting from a central keyword.

# Untitled

## 🗒️Task:
Contact a client

## 🛠️Prerequisites (if applicable): 
No relation with client.

## 📝Instructions:
#todo/check  The bottom line is:
1. To remind ourselves in the form of a question in the context of current topics - is there time and space? We have been talking about X in recent weeks, how can we continue this?
2. Add a simple motivator/personalisation as to why it's worth it - e.g. it's the end of the year, we have the capacity, the automation will already start working and helping, the automation will work nicely with the previous ones, etc.
3.  Frequency
    1.  Call ➝ If we have a good relationship, we'll call boldly 1-2 days after we send the proposal, ask how it's going, if they've had time, if they've read, etc.
    2.  Follow-up mail after proposal shipment 2-7 days (depending on relationship, insights, etc.) ➝ whether they got it, if there are questions, etc. etc.
4.  Follow-up #2 ➝ 3-7 days (it depends seriously) ➝ ask if it's a good time, we encourage you to just
5.  Follow-up #3 ➝ 5-10 days (no point in pressing if there was no contact before) ➝ We are parking the topic temporarily, because we see that they are probably overworked; we are available, we are willing to return to it; if they find the time, it is great if they let us know how we can help and if there is anything in the way

Ad hoc above, but it is only from the hand. In general, if we have a good relationship, we can use the phone, it can be tried, because it is often the simplest, fastest and least problem (phone + sms as if he did not answer, that on the email there is a topic, if it was time we will be happy to talk, and also it is possible to return to the topic in the future)
  
## Outcome:
Build a nice relation with client and get response from him.

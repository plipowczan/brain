# How to instantly trigger Make scenario on row created event from Airtable free plan

## üóíÔ∏èTask:
This is a workaround since there is no straight forward way to trigger a Make scenario instantly on row created event on a free plan. On paid plan you can run script or use mailhook to address which is not one of the collaborators address.

## üõ†Ô∏èPrerequisites (if applicable):¬†
- Gmail

## üìùInstructions:

1. Create mailhook in make and copy address
2. Add a forwarding address [Settings - Gmail (google.com)](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/3/#settings/fwdandpop) click button **Add a forwarding address**

11. Set action - check **Forward it to** and select forwarding address you added few steps earlier and click **Create filter**

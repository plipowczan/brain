# How to download webm video from URL (html page)

## üóíÔ∏èTask:
I have an URL and I would like to download the video webm file. I record videos using clickup and once it is generated I would like to download those recording and do some postprocessing on it and this is why I need the file.

## üõ†Ô∏èPrerequisites (if applicable):¬†
Web browser - I'm using Microsoft Edge

## üìùInstructions:
1. Open url with the file in browser and hit F12 to open developer tools

2. Use the **Select an element in the page to inspect it** option and try to point the whole video control - it might be hard so you can use the code to find the proper video component.

## Video:

## Outcome:
You will have the webm file downloaded.

This solution should also work with other video types - not only webm.

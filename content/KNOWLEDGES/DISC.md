# DISC
It has been known for a long time that the success of a company consists of many factors, including a team that is selected and motivated to work. Fortunately, there are tools that facilitate this. They help with recruitment, building relationships within teams, or individual development. One such tool is Extended DISC, a package based on a model developed by the renowned Swiss psychologist and psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung.

# How not to become a slave of your own business
## Three commandments:
1. You cannot loose.
	1. You are a winner from the start. Think of what you have and on start you have a lot. If you think about 3 things every day what you can be grateful [[LIFE/KNOWLEDGE/INFO/5 Minute Journal]] I guarantee - no matter who you are and in what situation you would be able to find those 3 things. 
	2. Business/life is an endless game and if it is endless you cannot loose.
2. Development is a choice - you don't have to do it but it gives you a great advantage in terms of building a business but if you just do it the development will come since you will learn on. Avoid constant pressure that you need more, that there is something you can do. [[BOOK/Company of one]] #reading-list/business-finance 
3. Enjoy it all - do it for fun (business and life). Enjoy the process and not only when you achieve something. Goal alternative:
	1. Values - what values you follow in life - write it down and stick to it and all decisions you make confront with those values.
	2. Direction - instead of defining a goal you can define a direction - you will avoid the pressure of not reaching the destination when you won't achieve the goal, if only you will go in the direction you defined you will be able to get somewhere and enjoy the process.
	3. Boundaries - to keep the right direction you have to move in the specified boundaries for example - don't drink alcohol because it makes bad impact on your productivity and health, sleep well - long and good quality etc.
	4. Rhythm - find your onw rhythm in which you work and live for example work in the morning or in the night - the time when you are more productive, work in batches - for 3 months very intensive and then 1 month free of work.

## 5 methods of actions:
1. Extend your working day to 48 hours - in order to do so you need a team, delegate all your work that you don't need to be involved in. Having someone else do the job and implement automations will allow you to create time space for yourself where you can focus only on yourself and develop/elaborate on your thoughts.
2.  Email marketing works - start building the email list around yourself. You would be able to use it in the future to sell something. However you need to know how to do it correctly.
3. I'm not relevant - the most important is the client. You need to develop your empathy to be able to step into another person's shoes and find and fulfill the client needs. [[BOOKS/W sercu emocji dziecka]] [[BOOKS/Twoje kompetentne dziecko]] You need to be able to feel your client emotions - this empathy is all about.
4. Only practice - stop taking courses, stop reading, start doing.
5. Errors are OK - you will make a lot of mistakes. But if you do something you gain either the money or the experience - if you do something wrong the important thing is to learn on your mistake and adjust 

You have to be yourself. Just do it and gain experience or gold or both :) Think a lot - using the time for yourself

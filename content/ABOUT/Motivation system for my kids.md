# Motivation system for my kids
[[ABOUT/Roles/Father]]

It is in constant development so it might change over time.

## What I tried
1. Schedules - created a weekly schedules on which kids could track their progress and show me how they did. It demanded some effort since this was made on paper - we had to plan it each week and print the schedules. They were not doing 

## Why
I believe that nothing should be given for free at least the money since it spoils the kids. That is why I developed a motivation earning system for my kids.

## How does it work
### Description
It is based on the Revolut Junior account and app [[LIFE/TOOLS/Revolut Junior]] and [[LIFE/TOOLS/Revolut]]

### The workflow:
1. I create tasks for my kids in the [[LIFE/TOOLS/Revolut]] app ex.: Wash teeth - I'm able to create a recuring tasks and most of them are recuring ones.
2. If they complete the task they mark it in their [[LIFE/TOOLS/Revolut Junior]] app.
3. I get notification whenever they complete the task.
4. At the end of day I check if all tasks from the day are completed - if so I transfer the money (automatically for all tasks - each task has its own amount - for the simplicity the amounts are the same because of the additional rules - see below).

### Additional rules:
1. They get money each day only when all tasks from that day are completed.
2. They get additional amount of money at the end of week when tasks for all days are completed.
3. They are not allowed to use cell or TV for entertainment purposes before they complete all tasks for the day.
4. They need to have at least one goal for money collecting and the amount of money they collect doesn't exceed the goal value.

## Update 2023 01
We needed to update the system to motivate children even more and implemented a rule where if they don't do certain task they will pay for it. To make it work we needed to introduce weekly checklists where they check done tasks and we settle the final amount at the end of week.

## Update 2023 02
Moreover I got some inspiration from podcast: [Paul ORFALEA czyli jak zarobić MILIARDY dzięki zamartwianiu się – Zen Jaskiniowca – zrozumieć i wcielić](https://zenjaskiniowca.pl/paul-orfalea-czyli-jak-zarobic-miliardy-dzieki-zamartwianiu-sie/)

## Update 2023 09
Changed electronic task creation to paper schedule. Each task in schedule is worth let's say 1zł. They have about 50 tasks so they can earn 50zł. However we by default each week take 20zł for keep. Like in real life - the keep expenses we all have.

We can introduce a rule from this podcast ex. give 5 USD from which 3 they can spend 1 share with others and 1 save for later.

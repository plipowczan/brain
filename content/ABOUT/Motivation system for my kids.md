# Motivation system for my kids
[[ABOUT/Roles/Father]]

It is in constant development so it might change over time.

## What I tried
1. Schedules - created a weekly schedules on which kids could track their progress and show me how they did. It demanded some effort since this was made on paper - we had to plan it each week and print the schedules. They were not doing 

## Why
I believe that nothing should be given for three at least the money since it spoils the kids. That is why I developed a motivation earning system for my kids.

## How does it work
### Description
It is based on the Revolut Junior account and app [[tools/Revolut Junior]] and [[tools/Revolut]]

### The workflow:
1. I create tasks for my kids in the [[TOOLS/Revolut]] app ex.: Wash teeth - I'm able to create a recuring tasks and most of them are recuring ones.
2. If they complete the task they mark it in their [[TOOLS/Revolut Junior]] app.
3. I get notification whenever they complete the task.
4. At the end of day I check if all tasks from the day are completed - if so I transfer the money (automatically for all tasks - each task has its own amount - for the simplicity the amounts are the same because of the additional rules - see below).

### Additional rules:
1. They get money only when all tasks from that day are completed
2. They get additional amount of money at the end of week when all days are completed
3. They are not allowed to use cell or TV for entertainment purposes before they complete all tasks for the day

# DISC
## My test results: ![[ATTACHMENTS/DISC Pawe≈Ç Lipowczan.pdf]]

## What to focus on:
- [ ] Be more active in discussions - show that you have a lot to tell and your knowledge is deep and wide.
- [ ] If someone criticize you don't forget to develop the subject and ask for feedback.
- [ ] Force myself to say more what I have to say, because if they don't know they cannot do anything about it.
- [ ] Speak about your feelings and emotions more.
- [ ] Focus what is important to me and what are my needs.

From: [[BOOKS/Building a Second Brain]]

1. Borrowed Creativity - Creativity is all about remixing knowledge
2. The Capture Habit - Whenever I come up with an idea I write it down. Whenever I read, watch or listen to something and there is an idea behind it I try to write it down:
	1. Listen - god to have a recorder - watch might be handy since it is always near and you can use it without interrupting your listening even when you are driving
	2. Read paper/Watch video - always read with a pen in your hand [[BOOKS/How to take smart notes]]
	3. Read ereader - highlight text and paraphrase it

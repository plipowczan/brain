# I hate to read
Since beginning of my life I didn't like to read and until now I wasn't able to change it.

# I preferred to read paper books
Until a few months ago, I was a staunch opponent of ebooks and ereaders. I belonged to the group of people to whom nothing can abate the smell of a book, its weight and the rustling of the pages. As I am the best proof of never saying never, it was time for a conversion. From the middle of 2022 I own a [[HARDWARE/Kindle]] and it was one of the best purchase I made in that time. Fun fact is that I made it mostly because of the travels - I travel a lot and carrying paper book was a big handicap especially when all the space you have is the hand luggage.

# What do I read
Since I don't like to read an I know that this is one of the most important thing, to learn on someone else knowledge, the only books I read are non fiction ones.

# How I do It
Since I don't like to read I like audiobooks and services like [Blinkist: Powerful ideasâ€”15 minutes at a time](https://www.blinkist.com/) where each book is presented in a very concise way in few (about 10) "blinks".

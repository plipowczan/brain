## To consider/implement

6 interesting habits:  
1. Bedding the bed - with this habit we complete the first task of the day which gives us a boost of dopamine and a positive mood for the next tasks.  
	- Clean surroundings, order works well for us.  
	- We start the day with success - this gives us good energy for the rest of the day  
2. Drinking water - lots of water - we get dehydrated while we sleep and therefore it is good to replenish water in the morning  
3. Brushing teeth  
	- I habitually drink water with lemon in the morning and such can damage tooth enamel  
	- I brush my teeth with my left hand, i.e. not my dominant hand, which I usually do - this creates new neural connections in the brain  
4. Breathing exercises - I am currently practicing Wim Hof's breathing exercises.  
	- The brain is about 2% of our body, but it uses 20% of all the body's resources, so it's good to "oxygenate" ourselves.  
	- Oxygen helps fight pathogens and helps the immune system work against them.  
5. Diary - to increase your brain power you can take notes, plan your day, write down your thoughts. Additionally, it is important to write down what you are grateful for. The brain thrives on gratitude. If you are not grateful for what you already have it will be difficult to devote yourself to something you want. To feel gratitude immediately, just list all the things you have that money can't buy. There is an article in times about people who live 80/90. According to the article, their longevity is influenced by the fact that they are grateful, they practice gratitude. The second aspect is that these people are lifelong learners. Further, many geniuses write diaries. Einstein, Marie Skłodowka Curie, Leonardo Da Vinci and others. They probably didn't keep diaries because they were geniuses but conversely they were geniuses because they did.  
6. Exercise - intense interval training or tabata (about 10 minutes) - exercise is good for the heart and usually if something is good for the heart it is also good for the brain. Besides, exercise helps oxygenate the brain by increasing the heart rate.

Thinking about your dreams - what dreams we had - often in our sleep we think about what happened during the day. Our brain even works at night and solves the problems we had during the day.

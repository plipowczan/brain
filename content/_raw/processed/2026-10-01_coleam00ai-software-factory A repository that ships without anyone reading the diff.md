## AI Software Factory

A repo that takes work in as an issue and ships validated code out, with nobody at the keyboard.

You file an issue. It gets checked against your mission, planned, built, judged by something that did not write it, and merged. A scheduled regression can re-test what already merged and publish bugs it finds.

Some people call this a dark factory, after lights-out manufacturing. Same idea. It builds software from a PRD, so I call it a software factory.

The automation is the easy half. Being able to trust a merge nobody read is the hard half, and most of what is in here exists for that.

All AI work runs through [Archon's SDLC pack](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon). This repo supplies the setup, scheduling, project context and ordinary app resources. Archon workflows handle every agent, from triage through verification and merge.

---

## Set it up

Paste this to your coding agent, in the repo you want the factory in:

```
Help me set up my own AI software factory in this repo using this GitHub repo:
https://github.com/coleam00/ai-software-factory

Read its README and follow the "Instructions for the agent" section.
Run the installer for me, then help me write the mission and validation journeys
based on this project. Configure Archon with my chosen coding agent and model tiers.
Every AI step must use the shared Archon SDLC workflows.
Leave scheduling off until we have watched one issue go through the factory.
```

That is the install. It clones this, runs the installer, then walks you through the three files nobody can write for you.

**You need:** git, Python 3.10+, [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) authenticated with the `workflow` scope (`gh auth login -s workflow`, then `gh auth setup-git` so git itself can push, including CI workflow files), a GitHub remote, a coding agent, [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Your agent can help install the missing tools. The installer brings its own pinned Archon source, including the shared workflows; you do not need to check out Archon or merge its PRs yourself.

**Current status:** the default pins exact Archon revision `a02b9ab6bc59f4aff6cae8bfca4723b3eadadb28`, whose SDLC pack supports grounded intake, reviewed delivery, scoped validation reuse, independent runtime and holdout verification, bounded repair, discovery handling, merge queues and deterministic deployment. Native live acceptance remains separate from installation readiness.

## Instructions for the agent

> This section is addressed to the coding agent. Run the setup for the user.

**1\. Install it.**

Read the application repo first. Check its GitHub remote, existing configuration, toolchain and authentication. Reuse working logins and ask the user to complete any interactive sign-in that is missing. Do not print credentials.

Clone the factory outside the application repo, or update an existing clean clone with `git pull --ff-only`:

```
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/ai-software-factory ~/ai-software-factory
```

Then, from the root of the **application repo**:

```
python ~/ai-software-factory/bin/factory.py init
```

Use `python3` if that is the Python command on the machine. If the user's repo lives on a server, run the installation and configuration there over SSH.

The installer writes the factory and project templates and installs the pinned Archon source. It preserves project configuration on upgrades. It does not configure provider authentication, change model tiers or start a schedule. It also adds one pointer to `factory/WORKFLOW_POLICY.md` in the project's native `AGENTS.md` without replacing existing guidance. That policy supplies the factory-specific bootstrap, runtime, review and state-label requirements that the general-purpose shared workflows intentionally do not assume.

**2\. Configure Archon.**

Read the installed source's configuration documentation and configure the user's chosen provider through native Archon settings. Preserve existing working settings. For Claude Code, Sonnet for small/medium and Opus for large is a useful starting point; use model identifiers supported by the installed provider and the user's account.

All factory AI work must run through the shared SDLC workflows. Do not add direct coding-agent subprocesses to factory scripts or create factory-local workflow copies.

**3\. Write the three files with them.**

The repo holds either an application or only a product document (a PRD). The interview is the same either way; a PRD answers what the code would have.

Read the repo FIRST. The language, the test command, the start command, the entry point and the routes are all in there, or the PRD is. Then ask at most four questions, each with your proposed answer already filled in so the cheapest reply is "yes". Every question the repo already answered is a reason to regret starting.

| File | What you are writing |
| --- | --- |
| `MISSION.md` | What this product is, and the list of things it must **never** become |
| `harness/END-TO-END.md` | Two to five journeys, in plain English, that a real user takes |
| `.factory/holdout/HOLDOUT.md` | Independent scenarios that combine the product's behavior |

**The out-of-scope list in `MISSION.md` is the one that decides whether any of this works.** It is how the factory recognises that a plausible, well-argued, easy request is drift rather than a good idea. Do not ask the user to produce it from nothing. Propose seven entries yourself from what you read, make them things a reasonable person would actually ask for, and have them strike the wrong ones.

Draft the holdout yourself, then tell the user to review it. A directory called "holdout" does not make it private: arrange actual isolation from the builder if these scenarios are meant to be hidden.

Journeys describe what the product **does today**, never what it should do. A journey for behaviour that does not exist yet leaves the gate red before the first lap, and nothing can merge, including the change that would make it pass. A PRD is the exception: it is the one document that describes behaviour before the code exists, so when the repo holds only a PRD, write all three files from it now, plus the harness commands (the interview decides the stack, so the declared gate has something to run). Replace the installed example journeys entirely; a merge assessor that finds task-service journeys in a pastebin holds the PR. Only the runtime host waits, for the start command the first ticket declares (step 5).

Configure the project's static/unit commands and translate the journeys into the runtime scenario inputs required by the shared workflows. Follow the installed `factory/RUNTIME_HOST.md` for ordinary app startup, fresh state and candidate resources. Bind preparation and start to the delivering commit, then run the documented calibration: baseline verified, a relevant deliberate fault failed, and a wrong-identity check inconclusive. Assertions must exercise real transitions and nonempty/nonzero user value rather than directly seeding the final state. The agent handles this wiring; the user supplies the product intent.

**4\. Check the installation and hand it back.**

```
python factory/consumer.py doctor
python factory/consumer.py list
```

Show any failures and what remains to configure. Doctor checks the installation and available workflows; it does not prove a live agent can sign in or complete a run.

**5\. Ask the one question that picks the path: existing codebase, or a PRD?**

*Existing codebase.* The user files issues. Give them the exact command for one small issue, using `archon-ship` for issue-to-PR or `archon-lifecycle` for the full verification-and-merge sequence. For lifecycle, prepare the scenario/holdout inputs and runtime host first. Start with merge approval enabled and discovery publication in preview mode.

*A PRD.* The factory creates the backlog from it:

```
python factory/consumer.py run archon-backlog --input prd=<path to the PRD> --input publication=approve
```

The shared workflow slices the document into ordered issues the way an engineering lead would, the first one making the product runnable end to end (start command, health check, build-identity endpoint, tests, CI). Re-running it never duplicates an issue. The first ticket's body names the exact start command and the health and build-id paths, so wire the runtime host from it now, before anything is built, and then every ticket, the first included, goes through `archon-lifecycle` with the journeys and holdout from step 3. There is no special first-ticket path: the lifecycle verifies the skeleton against the journeys before merging it, which is also the first proof the journeys are right. If the merge queue holds a PR, the reason is retained in the run. If hold publication was explicitly enabled, it is also a comment starting `<!-- archon-merge-hold -->`; re-run `archon-deliver` adopting the delivery run (`--adopt <run id>`) and the review turns that hold into a finding it fixes.

**6\. Stop there.** Leave scheduling off until the user has watched a lap complete. If they already asked you to run that first lap, continue within that scope.

---

## The three files that are yours

**`MISSION.md`** is what the product is, and what it must never become. The out-of-scope list is the part that does work: it is how an agent recognises that a plausible, well-argued, easy request is drift. Without it every request is arguably in scope, because almost every feature is defensible on its own. Aim for at least five, and make them things a reasonable person would actually ask for.

**`harness/END-TO-END.md`** is two to five journeys in plain English. Name the value you expect. "The page loads" passes against an app that returns an empty body forever. The setup agent turns those journeys into inputs for Archon's runtime verification workflow, which drives the running app and records what it observes.

**`.factory/holdout/HOLDOUT.md`** checks the same product through different combinations and edge cases. Checks the builder can read are useful, but they are not a hidden holdout. Keep private scenarios outside the builder's accessible checkout and give them only to the verification environment.

---

## Where the AI steps come from

The factory writes none of them. Every AI step is a workflow or command in Archon's shared SDLC pack. You can run the workflows individually or use the full composition.

| What you want | Shared Archon workflow |
| --- | --- |
| Turn a PRD into an ordered backlog of issues | `archon-backlog` |
| Check whether an issue is ready and in scope | `archon-triage` |
| Take an issue through planning, implementation and review to a PR | `archon-ship` |
| Implement an existing plan or repair a PR | `archon-deliver` |
| Review code or run project checks | `archon-review`, `archon-validate` |
| Exercise a running app and record evidence | `archon-verify-runtime` |
| Check a baseline and whether verification catches deliberate defects | `archon-verify-runtime-suite` |
| Re-test existing behavior and diagnose regressions | `archon-regress` |
| Recheck discoveries, deduplicate them and optionally publish issues | `archon-discoveries` |
| Check PRs and CI, then merge according to the selected approval mode | `archon-merge-queue` |
| Roll the default branch onto a running service and read the revision back | `archon-deploy` |
| Run shipping, runtime/holdout verification, bounded repair, discoveries, merge and deployment | `archon-lifecycle` |

**Ship runs its own triage.** You do not have to run triage first. Deliver can use an existing run's worktree to repair the same PR. Lifecycle connects the shared workflows; factory Python does not dispatch their individual stages.

The agents use the GitHub CLI inside these workflows for issue publication, CI checks and merging. Configure GitHub branch protection for the checks and reviews your project requires.

The source revision lives in [`pack.json`](https://github.com/coleam00/ai-software-factory/blob/main/template/factory/pack.json). Once the workflow PRs merge upstream, updating that pin moves new installs to the merged version. Existing installations update by pulling this repo and rerunning `init`. Workflow improvements belong in Archon's SDLC pack. Neutral standalone Archon users do not need `MISSION.md`, `factory/WORKFLOW_POLICY.md` or any other factory file; those are guidance and inputs supplied by this consumer.

---

## Commands

Run these from the application repo after installation:

```
python factory/consumer.py doctor
python factory/consumer.py list
python factory/consumer.py run archon-ship --input target=https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/1 --detach --json
python factory/consumer.py get <run-id> --json --events
python factory/consumer.py status --all --json
python factory/consumer.py approve <run-id> --comment "Approved"
python factory/consumer.py cancel <run-id>
python factory/consumer.py halt
```

`halt` blocks new launches and continuations. Cancel an active run explicitly; `unhalt` allows launches again. Runtime-host runs stay in the foreground.

After the first successful lap, ask your agent to configure `.factory/schedule.json` with a shared workflow and its inputs. `python factory/consumer.py tick` submits one whole workflow. `bash .factory/loop.sh` repeats it, every five minutes by default.

The scheduler never selects work itself. Backlog intake lives in the shared lifecycle: with an empty `target` and `publish=true`, each run takes the oldest open issue with none of the factory's configured state labels and no open PR naming it; a run that finds nothing completes with nothing to do. The consumer supplies the factory state-label mapping to triage, ship and lifecycle. An explicit `--input state_labels={}` or scheduled `"state_labels": {}` disables that default. A fixed `target` repeats that same target every tick.

Publication remains opt-in. A supervised schedule can label intake while leaving merge approval gated and discoveries read-only:

```
{
  "workflow": "archon-lifecycle",
  "inputs": {
    "target": "",
    "publish": "true",
    "scenario": "/private/runtime.json",
    "holdout": "/private/holdout.json",
    "merge_mode": "approve",
    "merge_method": "squash",
    "discovery_publication": "preview"
  }
}
```

To opt into evidence-backed hold comments, use the publication inputs together:

```
{
  "workflow": "archon-lifecycle",
  "inputs": {
    "target": "",
    "publish": "true",
    "scenario": "/private/runtime.json",
    "holdout": "/private/holdout.json",
    "merge_mode": "approve",
    "merge_method": "squash",
    "publish_holds": "true",
    "discovery_publication": "preview"
  }
}
```

`publish_holds` does not authorize merging, has no effect when `merge_mode` is `preview`, and is deliberately absent from the default example.

---

## Running it on a server

A factory that only runs while your laptop is open is a demo. It wants a Linux box that never sleeps. Any provider. Use the same setup prompt and tell your agent which server and application repo to use. [`docs/server-cheat-sheet.md`](https://github.com/coleam00/ai-software-factory/blob/main/docs/server-cheat-sheet.md) has every prompt for the whole server setup, in order, from the SSH key to the timer.

For Ubuntu, the agent can inspect and run [`bin/bootstrap-ubuntu.sh`](https://github.com/coleam00/ai-software-factory/blob/main/bin/bootstrap-ubuntu.sh) to install the toolchain, then help with GitHub and provider sign-in. Run the installer in the application repo on that server.

Watch one issue become a PR, verify the running app, and approve its merge before starting a persistent loop or OS timer. The service needs the same tool paths and authentication as the successful manual run. Installation does not start it for you.

**As a systemd service.** `init` installs `factory/factory-timer.service.example`; fill in the three placeholders and enable it. Three things the manual run had that a root service does not get on its own, and the example sets each of them:

- `HOME`: git's credential helper (`gh`) and Archon's `~/.archon` are found through it.
- `PATH`: `bun`, `uv` and `claude` live under the user's home, not `/usr/bin`.
- `IS_SANDBOX=1`: Claude Code refuses to run unattended as root without it.

Keep the Claude Code token in a mode-600 file the service sources (the example uses `~/.factory-env`), never in the unit or the repository. Each tick is one whole shared workflow; the loop waits `FACTORY_INTERVAL_SECONDS` after a tick ends before launching the next, so ticks never overlap. Stop it with `systemctl disable --now factory-timer` or `python factory/consumer.py halt`.

If a run pauses on a pending GitHub check, `python factory/consumer.py resume <run-id>` continues it once the check concludes; the CLI does not resume it for you.

Deployment is project-specific: the setup agent wires the service (systemd, a reverse proxy, DNS) and gives the lifecycle its `deploy`, `health` and `identity` commands. With those set, a confirmed merge runs the shared `archon-deploy` workflow, which rolls the default branch onto the service and reads the deployed revision back. Without them, a merge is only a merge.

---

## What it does not do

**It does not judge taste.** A green gate never means the product is good. It means the layer a machine can check is intact.

**It does not invent a backlog.** The backlog comes from you: issues you file, or a PRD you wrote that `archon-backlog` slices into issues you approve. Intake only picks up what is there. Discovery can publish verified findings; that is different from deciding what the product should become.

**It does not maintain a second set of AI workflows.** Factory runs the pinned shared SDLC source. Changes to agent behavior belong there.

---

## Cost

Instrument your tokens on day one. Start with one small issue and watch the model calls before enabling a loop. Use medium models for routine work and large models where the workflow needs the extra reasoning.

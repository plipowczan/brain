PULS  2022.10.28

ðŸ”¥Good news:
I managed to recruit few promising developers for one of my project. 

ðŸ“‹Priorities:
ðŸŸ¨1. Holding - Calculators feedback - waiting for further feedback
ðŸŸ©2. Holding - Client database update - moved columns from Client services to Clients
ðŸŸ¨3. Unifiedpost - got feedback and pushed some updates to the inFakt app - don't understand one remark and waiting for Glenn to explain
ðŸŸ¨4. Employee agreement generator - finished RODO dynamic document generation and almost done with responsibilities document

ðŸ›‘Roadblocks:

ðŸ§ Final word:

Base on the concept of weekly recuring meetings: [[PROJECTS/AH/PULS]]

PULS  2022.09.05

ðŸ”¥Good news:
Good weekend. Explored [[KNOWLEDGES/Zettelkasten]] (slip-notes) smart note taking system. It gave me the confirmation about what I already knew that I need to keep my notes in relation to each other and whatever I read I need to make notes. I recommend the "How to take smart notes".

ðŸ“‹Priorities:
1. Employee Agreement Management - prepare management of one agreement
2. Unifiedpost - push inFakt app
3. Tigers - monitor the tools, gather feedback and fix errors if any occur.

ðŸ›‘Roadblocks:

ðŸ§ Final word:
Holding Tools

Base on the concept of weekly recuring meetings: [[PROJECTS/AH/PULS]]

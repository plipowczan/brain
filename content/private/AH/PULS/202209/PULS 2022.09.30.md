PULS  2022.09.30

ðŸ”¥Good news:
I had a good morning - my wife and kids prepared waffles for breakfast with fruits and whipped cream. However by the time I finished my morning routine the whipped cream was gone but I like them with yoghurt so no disappointment and it was healthier.

ðŸ“‹Priorities:
ðŸŸ¨Holding - prepared the service table structure and final structure for client and calculators database, need to finish mapping for BI
ðŸŸ¥Holding - documentation - no hours capacity for that
ðŸŸ¥Unifiedpost - no feedback from Glenn about the app - maybe they will mention it on the meeting today

ðŸ›‘Roadblocks:
No capacity - I made too much hours. I have too many tasks for the time I have available (80 hours).

ðŸ§ Final word:

Base on the concept of weekly recuring meetings: [[PROJECTS/AH/PULS]]

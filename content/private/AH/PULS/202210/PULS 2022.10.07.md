PULS  2022.10.07

ðŸ”¥Good news:
Managed to plan the trip to Iceland. Everything seems to be set up.
Managed to prepare the app for Unifiedpost - added additional modules to the app - only need to test them.

ðŸ“‹Priorities:
ðŸŸ¨1. Holding - spending plan - prepared the structure for services, need to implement changes according to feedback and fit it to calculators
ðŸŸ¥2. Holding - Employee Agreement Generator - didn't move it forward due to engagement in another projects - plan to finish it in the second part of the month.
ðŸŸ©3. Unifiedpost - got feedback and started to work closely with Glenn, all modules are prepared - will do some more testing today and send it all to Glenn.

ðŸ›‘Roadblocks:

ðŸ§ Final word:
Iceland

Base on the concept of weekly recuring meetings: [[PROJECTS/AH/PULS]]

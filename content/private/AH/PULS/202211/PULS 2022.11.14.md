[[PULS 2022.11.14]]

ðŸ”¥Good news:
Good weekend with family. Good mountain trip.
My sun took part in his first regional ping pong tournament and did quite good. Managed to find a solution for some hard technical stuff.
I finally got my AH blouse and it is good timing since it is really cold and the blouse is really warm.

ðŸ“‹Priorities:
1. Holding - prepare documentation and instructions, HR process analysis
2. Holding - finish tests for document generation and UZ contracts
3. Unifiedpost - analyze feedback and finish 

ðŸ›‘Roadblocks:

ðŸ§ Final word:

Base on the concept of weekly recuring meetings: [[PROJECTS/AH/PULS]]

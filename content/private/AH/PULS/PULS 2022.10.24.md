PULS  2022.10.24

ðŸ”¥Good news:
Had a great weekend with family and friends. I finished the POC for Greg - we are trying to prepare a custom authentication provider for circle so the users from Eduweb are able to log in to Ahoy using their accounts in Eduweb.

ðŸ“‹Priorities:
1. Holding - Calculators mapping for BI
2. Holding - Client database update - move columns from Client services to Clients
3. Unifiedpost - get feedback and complete work on the inFakt app

ðŸ›‘Roadblocks:

ðŸ§ Final word:
new clients

Base on the concept of weekly recuring meetings: [[PROJECTS/AH/PULS]]

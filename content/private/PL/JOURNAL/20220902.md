# Evening
## Highlights of the day
1. Took assessment DISC test and analyzed the results 
2. Agreement with EIRIA - finished
3. Checked some copy texts

## What did I learn today?
1. Don't remember or nothing new.

## How can I improve?
1. Learn more - I can't remember if I learned something today or not. 
2. I could add new stuff for me to notes so I will remember it better and review it while doing it.
3. I can review done tasks and this way I might be able find out what I learned.

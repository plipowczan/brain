# Morning
## I am grateful for:
1. That my daughter Emily feels better and went to school.
2. That I feel good even though kids were coughing and sneezing all over the house and the weather is bad (cold, windy and the day is short - lack of D Vitamin).
3. Family who is supportive and have more less the same values - keeping touch with some of them is a pleasure.

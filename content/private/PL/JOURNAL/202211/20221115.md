# Morning
## I am grateful for:
1. I keep healthy even though my kids are sick and spread the bacteria all over their surrounding.
2. The sun which keeps me in good mood.
3. The possibility to work from everywhere in the world - the only thing I need is laptop.

## What would make today great? (top 3 priorities)
- [x] EDUWEB - prepare endpoints for sso authorization
- [ ] AH - work on the documentation and instructions
- [ ] Unifiedpost - finish app
- [ ] ATEM - instructions and fixes

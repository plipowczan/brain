# Evening
## Highlights of the day
1. Good consultation - might be better but I think it was quite OK.
2. ATEM - refresh information about the system
3. AH - fruitful day full of challenges

## What did I learn today?
1. [[KNOWLEDGES/HOWTOS/Synchronize Airtable with Webflow]]
2. Manage webhooks in Make apps
3. Prepare some content for the consultation next time to be able to use it when nobody talks - more than I had and better quality.
4. [[KNOWLEDGES/HOWTOS/Test email rating]]

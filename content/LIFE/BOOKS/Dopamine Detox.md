## Who Should Read It?
Everyone who would like to improve their productivity, fight procrastination and boost focus for the right tasks leading to achieving their goals.

# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me
I have implemented several techniques to improve productivity. I have pointed my main dopamine stimulation actions. I have planned few changes in my actions during the day. I implemented planning my top 3 task for the next day, the day before. I would like to implement also a basic dopamine detox trying to avoid one dopamine stimulation action like watching YouTube during the following days.

## 🧠 **Summary: Dopamine Detox by Thibaut Meurisse**

This book explores how dopamine—the brain’s reward chemical—can hijack your focus and productivity in a world overflowing with digital stimulation. Meurisse introduces a practical method to reset your brain’s reward system through a dopamine detox. The goal isn’t to eliminate pleasure, but to recalibrate your response to stimuli so that meaningful, long-term tasks become more engaging.

The detox involves:

- Identifying your biggest distractions
- Creating friction to reduce impulsive engagement
- Establishing a low-stimulation morning routine

By reducing overstimulation, you can regain control over your attention, improve productivity, and cultivate a more balanced lifestyle.

## 📝 **Journal Notes & Reflections**

### 🔍 Understanding Dopamine

- Dopamine drives the _anticipation_ of reward, not just pleasure.
- Overstimulation from social media, junk food, and constant notifications makes everyday tasks feel dull.
- Ask yourself: _What activities am I addicted to? Do they truly bring me happiness?_

### ⚠️ Challenges of Overstimulation

- High-dopamine habits (scrolling, binge-watching, sugar) create a cycle of restlessness.
- Long-term thinking suffers when instant gratification dominates.
- Food cravings are dopamine-driven—be mindful of sugar and fat consumption.

### 🧘‍♂️ Detox Strategies

- **48-hour full detox**: eliminate most stimulation (internet, processed food).
- **24-hour detox**: shorter but still impactful.
- **Partial detox**: remove one major source (e.g., YouTube) for a set period.
- Replace with low-stimulation activities: journaling, walking, reading, meditation.

### 🛠️ Three-Step Method

1. **Identify distractions**: Make a “Can Do” vs. “Can’t Do” list. [[LIFE/NOTES/Distractions]]
2. **Add friction**: Disable notifications, remove apps, hide devices.
3. **Morning routine**: Start with calm activities to set the tone. [[Habits]]

### 📅 Post-Detox Maintenance

- Plan your day with intention—prioritize tasks by impact.
- Create a “closed system” workspace to avoid distractions.
- Use triggers (tea, meditation) to initiate focus blocks.
- Accept relapses as learning moments.

### 🌱 Long-Term Integration

- Stay self-aware of relapse triggers.
- Create contingency plans (e.g., meditate instead of checking phone).
- Try a **30-day challenge** to solidify habits.
- Engage in serotonin-boosting activities: nature walks, deep conversations, mindfulness.

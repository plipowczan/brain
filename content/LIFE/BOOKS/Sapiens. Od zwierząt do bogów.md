# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me

How my life / behavior / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.
I have always been a Christian. I grow up in an environment where it was almost impossible to believe in something else since almost everyone Was very religious - almost everyone was either Catholic or Evangelical and even if someone thought differently didn't mention it publicly not to be disqualified by the society. Moreover if you are a child, you often has too less knowledge to think for yourself. It's like the belief in Santa Claus - you believed until you found out that it is all bullshit 🙈. It was my case and after reading this book I started to think about it all from a different perspective and I started to #toto/complete
While getting older you pay less and less attention to what others say and I try to surround myself with people who accept my views and do not judge by their beliefs and convictions

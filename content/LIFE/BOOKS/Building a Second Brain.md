# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
The book about building your second brain. The thing is that our brain is good in creating ideas and developing them but not good at storing them so it is good to have a place to store the ideas and our thoughts about what we read and listen - elaborate on those ideas and what we read, watch and listen.
# 🎨 Impressions

## Who Should Read It?
Anyone who wants to take advantage of note taking and using all the information that you would forget in order to use it in the future in your upcoming projects.
# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me
I try to create notes whenever I can and put them here in using [[LIFE/TOOLS/Obsidian]].

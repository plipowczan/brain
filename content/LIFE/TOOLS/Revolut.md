## Reasoning for
I use it to manage some part of my finance. Manage my kids finances [[ABOUT/Motivation system for my kids]] [[LIFE/TOOLS/Revolut Junior]]. It is especially useful for travelling since it has built in multiple accounts for multiple currencies.
1. I'm able to spend money in over 140 currencies at the market exchange rate.
2. I'm able to withdraw cash from ATM for free (not all ATM-s - some of them take a charge - need to be careful about it).
3. Basic travel insurance for my whole family (Metal Plan 50 PLN/month): [Travel Insurance | Revolut Help Centre | Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/help/insurance-products/insuring-my-travel)

## Reasoning for
It can be used for organizing tasks and manage them. I use it because:
- it is simple - it doesn't have a lot of unnecessary features which might distract you from the mail purpose of the app
- it integrates with [[BUSINESS/TOOLS/Outlook]]
- it allows me to share tasks to this tool wherever I am and whichever device I use
- it integrates with focus sessions (based on [[LIFE/KNOWLEDGE/INFO/Pomodoro]]) (i use it sometimes)
- it is completely free
## Alternatives considered

## üß©Features:
- Straighten up - Hierarchies are a common facet of life in societies around the world, so give yourself an advantage with good posture.
- Care for yourself with the same tenderness you would a loved one - we often care for the one we love more than for ourselves - this rule is about changing that.
- The wrong companions can drag you down, so choose your friends wisely - get rid of toxic relationships and look for those that can make you a better person.
- Progress is made by comparing yourself to your past achievements, not to others - you need to focus on yourself and reference KPI-s to yourself. Each person has different background, environment and history so there is no point for comparing yourself to another person.
- It is a parent‚Äôs duty to raise a responsible and kind child - children are evil by nature and they need to know and accept the boundaries and the duty of the parents are to set them up.
- The world is filled with injustices, but we should not blame others for our lot in life - suffering is a part of human life and we should accept it and move on.
- Sacrifice can be a meaningful act, and we should seek meaning over immediate pleasures - we often choose pleasure over our own good and it should be inverted.
- Lies are a common tool of self-deception, but we should strive toward truthful living.
- Conversations are an opportunity to learn and grow, not compete.
- The complexity of life should be confronted with clear and precise language.
- There are bad and oppressive men, but we must avoid suppressing human nature.
- Life is hard and full of sorrow, so it‚Äôs important to celebrate the small joys in life.

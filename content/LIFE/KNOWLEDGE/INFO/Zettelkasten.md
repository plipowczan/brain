The concept from the book [[LIFE/BOOKS/How to take smart notes]]

## The 8 Steps of Taking Smart Notes

Ahrens recommends the following 8 steps for taking notes:

1. Make fleeting notes
2. Make literature notes
3. Make permanent notes from literature and fleeting notes
4. File permanent notes in slip-box 
5. Make references to other notes.
6. Add permanent note to index (by keyword).
7. Add tags to note.
8. Elaborate - look for connections with other notes and add relations

Hints: 

1. Read with a pen in your hand.
2. Don't try to confirm what you already know.
3. Write notes for You in the future (you might not know the context and general knowledge)
4. Make smart notes part of your reading routine.
5. Elaborate - look for connections with what you already know.

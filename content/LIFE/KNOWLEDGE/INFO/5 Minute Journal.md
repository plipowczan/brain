# 5 Minute Journal

## 🗒️ Description
This is a concept of keeping a diary. To write few sentences every day in a structured way.

I took the concept from book [[LIFE/BOOKS/Miracle morning]]

## 🧩Features:
1. Morning:
- Gratitude practice - write what you are grateful for. [[LIFE/KNOWLEDGE/INFO/Gratitude]]
- Top 3 priorities - write 3 to 5 priorities which would make today great.
2. Evening:
- Highlights of the day - write what I accomplished on that day
- What did I learn today?
- How can I improve?

I modified it for my convenience.
I used to write using a paper notebook but now I do it digitally using [[LIFE/TOOLS/Obsidian]] and using a template: [[templates/daily_journal]]

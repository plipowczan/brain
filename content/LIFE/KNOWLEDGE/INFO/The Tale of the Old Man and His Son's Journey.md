# The Tale of the Old Man and His Son's Journey

## üóíÔ∏è Description
Story which teaches us that we should not judge events as good or bad, because life is full of surprises and it is difficult to predict their consequences.

## üß©Features:
Once upon a time, there lived an old man who had a single son, and that son was the apple of his eye. The old man and his son lived a peaceful life on their farm, toiling away day by day. However, one morning, the son decided to venture into the nearby forest.

After a few hours, he returned home, leading behind him a group of magnificent wild horses he had discovered in the woods. The people in the neighborhood marveled at these beautiful creatures, and everyone said that the old man's son was incredibly lucky to stumble upon such treasures.

But as fate would have it, life can be unpredictable. Shortly after this incident, the son fell from one of the horses, breaking his leg and becoming crippled. People began to sympathize with the old man, saying that he now had bad luck, as his son was incapable of working.

Not long after these events, a war broke out, and all the young men in the area were drafted into the army. However, due to his disability, the old man's son was exempt from military service. Once again, people spoke, saying that the old man was fortunate because his son had escaped the horrors of war.

The old man listened to all these comments but repeated each time, "What happened to my son is neither good nor bad. It simply happened." He was a wise man who understood that fate was full of surprises and that one should not always judge events as either lucky or unlucky. He accepted life as it came, without passing judgment based on individual occurrences.

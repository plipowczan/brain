# Pareto

## 🗒️ Description
Pareto is a principle that states that 80% of outcomes come from 20% of the efforts. It's commonly used in business to indicate that most results are generated by a small portion of work. In other words, it suggests that the majority of outputs come from a minority of inputs.

# How to create a task for delegation

## 🗒️Task:
How to create a task so you would be able to delegate it.

## 🛠️Prerequisites (if applicable): 
#todo/replace If you have different pricing tiers, this should include information about which products or pricing plans this how-to applies to.

## 📝Instructions:
A well-defined task has:

1. Description - if it does not follow from the name of the task and you need to expand
2. Definition of done - information when the task can be considered completed
3. One owner - it should be assigned to one person - if there are two it's almost as if there is none 🙂 - you can always mark someone or add as a watcher then he will get the appropriate notification and that is enough if he is not directly related to the task. You can also duplicate the task if you expect feedback from several people and it is necessary then that is a better way 
4. Due date - without a due date it is hard start working on the task. However it is hard to determine it if we do not have well-defined previous points 1-3

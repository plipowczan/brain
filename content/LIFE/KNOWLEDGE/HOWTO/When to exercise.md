# When to exercise?

## üóíÔ∏è Description
Physical exercises play a crucial role in maintaining overall health by improving cardiovascular function, strengthening bones and muscles, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Regular physical activity can also improve mental health and mood, boost energy levels, and promote better sleep. In addition, physical exercises can also contribute to a healthy weight, improve balance and coordination, and enhance flexibility and endurance.

- people who exercise at 7 a.m. or between 1 - 4 p.m., slightly speed up their biological clock, so that they have more energy the next morning,  
- people who exercise late in the evening (7 - 10 pm) delay their biological clock, making it harder for them to get down to their daily tasks the next morning. They still had more energy during the day, but the "surge" of energy came later than in people who exercised at more optimal hours.  
## üß©Features:

- **6-10 morning** - During these hours, your body gradually wakes up. You may feel sluggish/ sluggish. To counteract morning sluggishness and wake up faster - it is best to use exercise and food. 
  Therefore, the first hour after waking up will be the best time for moderately intense movement, followed by breakfast. Such activity during these hours will have a stabilizing and calming effect on you.
- **10-14 noon** - These are the hours when the mind and the digestive system are working with the greatest power. During these hours you don't need movement, because your body is already fully awake. In addition - it's a shame to spend this time on physical activity that will further stimulate you, especially since these are the hours when you will be most productive at work.
- **14-18 evening** - This is a time of good reflexes and quick thinking, but also a time during the day when we may feel dehydrated, anxious and jittery. If you haven't eaten a decent meal between 10am and 2pm, you may crave snacks and coffee. It's better then to take some time for physical activity that will help you get grounded. Also remember to hydrate yourself.
- **18 ‚Äì 22 night** - The body becomes sluggish and dull, preparing for sleep. Physical exertion at this hour sounds tempting, but it can completely negate a good night's sleep.

# What mistakes I made on the crypto market in 2021-2022

## What mistakes I took
1. Didn't take profit
2. Didn't make own research
3. Didn't listen to Phil Konieczny - he said that we should get back to bitcoin, if I had done what he said I would save a lot from the losses I took
4. Trusted in Luna
5. Getting into Polkadot parachains - it was too late
6. Getting into project I didn't fully understand

## What worked
1. Following influencers - getting into the projects, they talked about, early
2. Diversification - it was good that I kept my assets in few places
3. I moved some BTC to ledger

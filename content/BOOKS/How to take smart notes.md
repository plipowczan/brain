# 🎨 Impressions

## How I Discovered It

I explored [[KNOWLEDGES/Zettelkasten]] concept and in one article on the Internet this book was mentioned.

## Who Should Read It?

Everyone who would like to make good notes and take advantage of them in the efficient way.

# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me

This was the "why" for taking notes while reading and looking for the purpose of reading and learning specified stuff. The important thing for me was finding the purpose of note taking - it is not just collecting information; it is seeking to develop ideas and arguments. I try to read with a pen in my hand - I always did but now I know that it makes sense.

# 📒 Summary + Notes

Systematically make three types of notes to develop your ideas and arguments:
1. Fleeting notes - they don’t go in a slip-box; they’re simply for capturing ideas and thoughts. You can take them in a notebook, on a scrap of paper, or wherever works for you. Keep these notes in one place so you can go through them later.
2. Literature notes - notes about what you read. While you’re reading, write down things you don’t want to forget along with reference details. Your notes should be short and in your own words. These go into your reference slip-box– the first of the two slip-boxes.
3. Permanent notes - These will arise from your fleeting and literature notes, which you should go through regularly– preferably daily. As you review your notes, ask yourself what’s relevant to your own ideas, your research, and your interests. Remember that you’re not just collecting information; you’re seeking to develop your ideas and arguments. Ask how the information you’re recording adds to your existing notes. Does it contradict, correct, or support them? Do new ideas come to mind? Do any new questions arise?

One permanent note per idea. Don't copy, create something new - precise and concise and include sources

File permanent notes in slip-box and make references to other notes.

Index - tag notes and place them in index - keywords with a link to an entry point to particular subjects in your.

Brain capability: it is “a machine for jumping to conclusions”– it has a habit of filling in gaps and making connections and patterns that simply aren’t there. By writing, you externalize your thinking process. And this allows you to see facts and rationalize your thoughts more clearly.

Read with a pen and paper in your hand #hint

Pearl of wisdom from Benjamin Franklin: read with a pen in hand. And, while reading, “enter in a little book short hints of what you feel that is common or that may be useful.”

With a slip-box, the reason for your reading and note-taking is perfectly clear: to build on your previous notes and arguments.

Confirmation bias - don't try to confirm what you already know. #hint

For who you are taking notes (for yourself in the future) - you’re doing so for someone who may have general knowledge in the field, but perhaps doesn’t know the specifics and the original context.

Elaboration - looking for connections with what you already know. Your slip-box enhances elaboration. It is when you think about the meaning of what you're reading and how it relates to your own thoughts, ideas, and arguments.

Make smart notes part of your reading routine. #hint

## Summary
Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten, or slip-box, is an innovative way to externalize your thoughts and build up a reservoir of ideas, arguments, and information. Used correctly, it’ll become like a conversation partner and will ultimately make it easier for you to write academic papers, think more clearly, and improve both your long-term learning and understanding.

# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
We are constantly inundated with information about multitasking and becoming more and more productive, only to close more tasks. But we don't ask whether these tasks are leading us to our goals (as long as we set them). The author focuses on finding one goal and then gradating the tasks into daily small steps.

# 📒 Summary + Notes

Key takeways:
-Life is a juggling of 5 balls. Work, family, health, spirituality, friends. However, it turns out that the ball of work is rubber and the rest is glass. If you drop the work, it will bounce back, but dropping the glass balls can irreparably damage or even shatter!  
-Set one professional goal to pursue. The rest is distraction. However, this does not apply to the rest of life (again, family, health, spirituality and friendships), here set goals for each category and keep an eye on them every day, because here failing any part, you will not make up for it.  
-Work-life balance doesn't work, but it's worth turning the game around by using counterbalance.

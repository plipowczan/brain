# ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me
I started to get up early and it was great in the beginning. For about a year I got up early and did my morning routine. The main reason why I changed the waking hour was that I struggled with getting to bed early enough to maintain about 8 hours sleep. I had also some health issues. Nevertheless I moved getting up from 5:00 to 6:20, and since about 2 years it works for me. I developed most of my habits based on this book: [[ABOUT/HABITS/Habits]]

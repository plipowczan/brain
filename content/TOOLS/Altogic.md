# Altogic

## Reasoning for
I use it for several things:
- Build basic backend software really fast using code or nocode
- To prototype API's

More use cases:
-   Creating user accounts, sessions and authorizing user sessions to execute services using access groups
-   Creating, modifying, deleting, and retrieving data
-   Caching data in memory for faster access
-   Paginating and iterating over large datasets
-   Executing multiple database operations at once using transactions
-   Uploading, downloading, and managing files
-   Connecting to external services that expose a RESTful API (including payments, authentication providers, etc.)
-   Graphically building complex business logic using core, custom, and marketplace nodes and connectors
-   Asynchronously execute complex or time-consuming business logic using message queues
-   Scheduling tasks to run periodically at fixed times, or intervals
-   Injecting custom code to your backend applications to handle edge cases when needed

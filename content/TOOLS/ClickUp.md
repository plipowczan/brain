## Reasoning for
You can organize tasks for your team and easy collaborate on whatever the tasks are related to like documents, whiteboards, mindmaps etc. It is highly customizable so you are able to adjust it for your team. I use it in my professional life because:
- it is highly adjustable
- it manages notifications pretty well - I like the notification view which gathers all mentions, activities in watched tasks and activities in tasks you are assigned to in to one readable view - it is really useful for asynchronous work 
- it has great number of useful features which are well organized around the main thing - tasks
- it has built in documents like in [[TOOLS/Notion]]
- it has great collaboration features
- it is free for great majority of most important (for me) features

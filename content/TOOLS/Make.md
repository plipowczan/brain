# Make
Make allows you to visually create, build, and automate workflows.

## Links
### Description
[Make | Work the way you imagine](https://www.make.com/en)
### Download
No download - online.
## Reasoning for
I use it for several things:
1. To automate repetitive work by setting small task
2. To integrate tools with each other - trigger workflow in one tool and do something in another
3. To transform data - create data based on the existing one transforming it on the way

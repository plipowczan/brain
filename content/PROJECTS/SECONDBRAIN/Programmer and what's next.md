# Programmer and what's next

when you end up school you know nothing about programming - it doesn't matter if the school is about computer science or not.

Share your knowledge. Get out of your comfort zone. Writing technical articles make you understand the topic better and exposes you to the evaluation of others and a different perspective by which if someone refers to the text there is a good chance that they will complete it. Besides, sharing knowledge is a great feeling.

Programming gives you freedom because you can write code everywhere - all you need is notebook and a bit of space where you can focus. However if you end up in company where you have to work on site and in specified hours it is not possible so you need to find company with a remote ethics. Moreover you cannot be fully free in some cases when you are asked to code boring things - the same things over and over again - you gain no experience by doing so or you are building something that you don't agree with or don't understand. One more important thing - for some people - including me the most important thing is to see the code in action and when you code a big system it is hard to achieve that since you need a long time to create working version and your part is so small that you won't be able to easily notice your part. That is the reason I turned in some part into nocode and automation since you can gain this feeling easier and see your effort pay off much faster.

The society broadens your perspective and right people gives you good hints and great ideas. 

When you look backwards you notice that all the dots form a straight line and when you look ahead you notice that there are so many dots and it is all a mess ( #todo/check Steve Jobs?).

You need to be in the right place in the right time but the most important thing is that you need to be prepared for that. However the opportunities are like busses. When one is gone there will "always" be another one - hate that word "always" because you cannot be certain so more appropriate would be writing "there is a high probability". Sometimes the problem is that there are too many opportunities and then you need to learn how to say "no" and pick the right one - pareto 20/80 - find the 20 percent which gives you 80 percent of results. [[LIFE/KNOWLEDGE/INFO/Pareto principle]]

There is one thing that is worth doing ... "doing" - whatever it is just do it (nike ;) - you most likely fail but you will learn on the way so you either gain experience or cash [[ABOUT/I have a business and not business has me]].

One of the most important thing in running a business is to create an appropriate team. Finding a good person for the right position is very hard, and the costs of hiring the wrong employee are very high. So it occurs that the old Russian proverb is very true: "Trust, but verify" [Trust, but verify - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify).

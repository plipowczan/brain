# Outlook
Mail, calendar and task management app.

## Links
### Description
If you want to communicate, organize your work and complete tasks with personal email and calendar this is a good app to help you with it. It is a part of other desktop apps like Word and Excel in the Office 365 Environment or Microsoft 365.
### Download or use
Use: [Mail - Paweł Lipowczan - Outlook (live.com)](https://outlook.live.com/mail/0/)
Download: [Download Microsoft Outlook dla komputerów Mac dla usługi Office 365 from Official Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/download/details.aspx?id=45915)
## Reasoning for
It can be used mainly for organizing your mail. You can keep all email accounts in one place and be able to manage it. It is also to manage tasks, calendar and contacts. I use it because:
- I got used to it - i use it since the very beginning of this tool existance
- It integrates with other tools I use ex. [[LIFE/TOOLS/Microsoft To Do]] 
- It allows me to manage my mail effectively
- It allows me to manage my meetings effectively - schedule, accept, decline etc. - it gives me a hard time sometimes since I have to keep all events in one calendar which is hard but if I get a meeting request I can put it straight into my outlook calendar.
- It allows me to manage my contacts.
- It allows me to manage my calendar.
- It allows me to minimize the tools list because having multiple apps to manage all of the above things I can have one which manages it all.

## Notes
Beautiful country with many breathtaking sites. Still very wild however this is only a matter of time people commercialize the wilderness prohibit some actions like swimming in springs and walking through canyons. Right now the only thing you can't do is to litter.
The roads are pretty good but only the main ones since the local ones are sometimes gravel and demand 4x4 vehicles.

It turned out to be an effective way to take notes and organize information. This system allows you to quickly identify and record key information. It also provides a way to review and recall information later.\n\nIt is based on the simple principles:\n\nDivide notes page into 4 sections:\n1. Title section (optional)\n2. Keywords/comments/questions section (30% width)\n3. Notes section (70% width)\n4. Summary section\n\nLike this:\n![[Pasted image 20220821205449.png]]\n\nAs you listen to a lecture or read a chapter, record the main ideas in the \"Notes\" section. Then, write down key details and your thoughts in the \"Keywords/comments/questions\" section.\n\nWhen you're finished taking notes, review each section and highlight important points. Then, create a summary of your notes by writing a brief overview of the main ideas in the \"Summary\" section.\n\n# Why Should You Use Cornell Notes?\n\nBesides being a very efficient way of taking great notes in class, Cornell note taking is THE perfect tip for exam preparation. Here‚Äôs why:\n\nThe system itself encourages you to reflect on your notes by actively summarizing them in their own words. Often, this can already be enough to remember study notes and to successfully pass an exam.\n\nWhen reviewing your notes it‚Äôs also useful to reorder objects on the page, for example, to add a solution to an answer on the side to the notes.\n\nYT:\n[How to Take Cornell Notes (with examples) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWfXWM4kco)","lastmodified":"2022-08-22T06:30:59.504670887Z","tags":null},"/TRAVEL/Island":{"title":"Island","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-08-22T06:30:59.504670887Z","tags":null}}

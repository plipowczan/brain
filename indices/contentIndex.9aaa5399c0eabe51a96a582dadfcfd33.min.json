Business/life is an endless game and if it is endless you cannot loose.\n2. Development is a choice - you don't have to do it but it gives you a great advantage in terms of building a business but if you just do it the development will come since you will learn on. Avoid constant pressure that you need more, that there is something you can do. [[BOOK/Company of one]] #reading-list/business-finance \n3. Enjoy it all - do it for fun (business and life). Enjoy the process and not only when you achieve something. Goal alternative:\n\t1. Values - what values you follow in life - write it down and stick to it and all decisions you make confront with those values.\n\t2. Direction - instead of defining a goal you can define a direction - you will avoid the pressure of not reaching the destination when you won't achieve the goal, if only you will go in the direction you defined you will be able to get somewhere and enjoy the process.\n\t3. Boundaries - to keep the right direction you have to move in the specified boundaries for example - don't drink alcohol because it makes bad impact on your productivity and health, sleep well - long and good quality etc.\n\t4. Rhythm - find your onw rhythm in which you work and live for example work in the morning or in the night - the time when you are more productive, work in batches - for 3 months very intensive and then 1 month free of work.\n\n## 5 methods of actions:\n1. Extend your working day to 48 hours - in order to do so you need a team, delegate all your work that you don't need to be involved in. Having someone else do the job and implement automations will allow you to create time space for yourself where you can focus only on yourself and develop/elaborate on your thoughts.\n2.  Email marketing works - start building the email list around yourself. You would be able to use it in the future to sell something. However you need to know how to do it correctly.\n3. I'm not relevant - the most important is the client. You need to develop your empathy to be able to step into another person's shoes and find and fulfill the client needs. [[BOOKS/W sercu emocji dziecka]] [[BOOKS/Twoje kompetentne dziecko]] You need to be able to feel your client emotions - this empathy is all about.\n4. Only practice - stop taking courses, stop reading, start doing.\n5. Errors are OK - you will make a lot of mistakes. But if you do something you gain either the money or the experience - if you do something wrong the important thing is to learn on your mistake and adjust \n\nYou have to be yourself.

It describes the slip-box technique and describe who invented it and how it worked for him. Approach to note-taking was inspired by the 20th-century German sociologist Niklas Luhmann.\n# 🎨 Impressions\n\n## How I Discovered It\n\nI explored [[KNOWLEDGES/Zettelkasten]] concept and in one article on the Internet this book was mentioned.\n\n## Who Should Read It?\n\nEveryone who would like to make good notes and take advantage of them in the efficient way.\n\n# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me\n\nThis was the \"why\" for taking notes while reading and looking for the purpose of reading and learning specified stuff. The important thing for me was finding the purpose of note taking - it is not just collecting information; it is seeking to develop ideas and arguments. I try to read with a pen in my hand - I always did but now I know that it makes sense.\n\n# Summary + Notes\n\nSystematically make three types of notes to develop your ideas and arguments:\n1. Fleeting notes - they don’t go in a slip-box; they’re simply for capturing ideas and thoughts. You can take them in a notebook, on a scrap of paper, or wherever works for you. Keep these notes in one place so you can go through them later.\n2. Literature notes - notes about what you read. While you’re reading, write down things you don’t want to forget along with reference details. Your notes should be short and in your own words. These go into your reference slip-box– the first of the two slip-boxes.\n3. Permanent notes - These will arise from your fleeting and literature notes, which you should go through regularly– preferably daily. As you review your notes, ask yourself what’s relevant to your own ideas, your research, and your interests. Remember that you’re not just collecting information; you’re seeking to develop your ideas and arguments. Ask how the information you’re recording adds to your existing notes. Does it contradict, correct, or support them? Do new ideas come to mind? Do any new questions arise?\n\nOne permanent note per idea. Don't copy, create something new - precise and concise and include sources\n\nFile permanent notes in slip-box and make references to other notes.\n\nIndex - tag notes and place them in index - keywords with a link to an entry point to particular subjects in your.\n\nBrain capability: it is “a machine for jumping to conclusions”– it has a habit of filling in gaps and making connections and patterns that simply aren’t there. By writing, you externalize your thinking process. And this allows you to see facts and rationalize your thoughts more clearly.\n\nRead with a pen and paper in your hand #hint\n\nPearl of wisdom from Benjamin Franklin: read with a pen in hand. And, while reading, “enter in a little book short hints of what you feel that is common or that may be useful.”\n\nWith a slip-box, the reason for your reading and note-taking is perfectly clear: to build on your previous notes and arguments.\n\nConfirmation bias - don't try to confirm what you already know. #hint\n\nFor who you are taking notes (for yourself in the future) - you’re doing so for someone who may have general knowledge in the field, but perhaps doesn’t know the specifics and the original context.\n\nElaboration - looking for connections with what you already know. Your slip-box enhances elaboration. It is when you think about the meaning of what you're reading and how it relates to your own thoughts, ideas, and arguments.\n\nMake smart notes part of your reading routine. #hint\n\nRead with a clear purpose or goal in mind #hint \n\n## Summary\nNiklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten, or slip-box, is an innovative way to externalize your thoughts and build up a reservoir of ideas, arguments, and information. Used correctly, it’ll become like a conversation partner and will ultimately make it easier for you to write academic papers, think more clearly, and improve both your long-term learning and understanding.","lastmodified":"2022-09-15T16:10:12.051944192Z","tags":null},"/BOOKS/Miracle-morning":{"title":"Miracle morning","content":"\n# Miracle morning\n\nDate Finished: 5th February 2018\nAuthor: Hal Elrod\n\n---\n# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nDiscover the miracle of getting up early and.

For about a year I got up early and did my morning routine. The main reason why I changed the waking hour was that I struggled with getting to bed early enough to maintain about 8 hours sleep. I had also some health issues. Nevertheless I moved getting up from 5:00 to 6:20, and since about 2 years it works for me. I developed most of my habits based on this book: [[ABOUT/HABITS/Habits]]\n# 📒 Summary + Notes\n### The elements of what should a great morning contain:\n1. Silence\n2. Reading\n3. Affirmations\n4.

Rear view mirror syndrome - Looking back.  \n2. Lack of purpose.\n3. Isolated events - every event is important, one cannot indulge oneself, discipline is important, and if one agrees to make concessions then consciously  \n4. Lack of responsibility - one must be responsible to someone for an action or its consequences because it forces action. Duty is something we sometimes don't like but we have to do no matter what.  \n5. Try to get a co-responsible partner - someone who will support and hold you accountable in the pursuit of established have goals  \n6.

It turned out to be an effective way to take notes and organize information. This system allows you to quickly identify and record key information. It also provides a way to review and recall information later.\n\nIt is based on the simple principles:\n\nDivide notes page into 4 sections:\n1. Title section (optional)\n2. Keywords/comments/questions section (30% width)\n3. Notes section (70% width)\n4. Summary section\n\nLike this:\n![[ATTACHMENTS/Pasted image 20220821205449.png]]\n\nAs you listen to a lecture or read a chapter, record the main ideas in the \"Notes\" section. Then, write down key details and your thoughts in the \"Keywords/comments/questions\" section.\n\nWhen you're finished taking notes, review each section and highlight important points. Then, create a summary of your notes by writing a brief overview of the main ideas in the \"Summary\" section.\n\n# Why Should You Use Cornell Notes?\n\nBesides being a very efficient way of taking great notes in class, Cornell note taking is THE perfect tip for exam preparation. Here’s why:\n\nThe system itself encourages you to reflect on your notes by actively summarizing them in their own words. Often, this can already be enough to remember study notes and to successfully pass an exam.\n\nWhen reviewing your notes it’s also useful to reorder objects on the page, for example, to add a solution to an answer on the side to the notes.\n\nYT:\n[How to Take Cornell Notes (with examples) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWfXWM4kco)","lastmodified":"2022-09-15T16:10:12.051944192Z","tags":null},"/KNOWLEDGES/DISC":{"title":"DISC","content":"\n# DISC\nIt has been known for a long time that the success of a company consists of many factors, including a team that is selected and motivated to work.

Borrowed Creativity - creativity is all about remixing knowledge\n2. The Capture Habit - whenever you come up with an idea you should write it down. Whenever you read, watch or listen to something and there is an idea behind it you should try to write it down in your own words:\n\t1. Listen - god to have a recorder - watch might be handy since it is always near and you can use it without interrupting your listening even when you are driving\n\t2. Read paper/Watch video - always read with a pen in your hand [[BOOKS/How to take smart notes]]\n\t3. Read e-reader - highlight text and paraphrase it\n3. Idea Recycling - reuse the ideas, materials and notes down the line, when you put all your thoughts in your second brain you won't forget them and be able to use them again in another projects\n4. Projects Over Categories - instead of categorizing notes the better solution is to put them in specified projects. In this way you would be able to take advantage of them straight away in your projects. You doesn't have to put it in a specified folder - just link or bookmark them in the specified project.\n5. Slow Burns - the opposite of heavy lift - the situation when you want to do all the work at once in some short amount of time. Instead you can work on all your project at once and let them \"burn\" slowly - whenever you come to an idea related to the project or link some note to it (see previous point) you are actually developing this project and you slowly moves it forward.\n6. Start With Abundance - whenever you start to work on something you never start from the blank page because with all the information you gathered in your second brain you can start with the abundance of information\n7. Intermediate Packets (content blocks) - paragraphs or points like this note - each of this point is a separate intermediate packet which you can reuse in some other project you are working on. Moreover working on the small pieces of information is easier and less scarry to begin with and there is less chance to procrastinate because of it. Working on a small piece is always easier - how to eat an elephant? piece by piece :)\n8. You Only Know What You Make - you can read, watch and listen to everything but you are able to memorize it all better if you implement and start using it or at least try it. Imagine all the books you read and all ideas you had, all texts you wrote and didn't store them somewhere - where are they now? Probably gone forever and what if you had it in your brain - you would be able to reuse and get back to it whenever you like to. You can say that you have lost the time spent on reading, watching and listening because nothing came of it.\n9. Make it Easier for Your Future Self - when making notes you should do it in the way you could be able to understand it in the future without the context.\n10. Keep Your Ideas Moving - there is a catch - you shouldn't just take notes and make huge database of information. Unless it becomes useful and you can implement it or make use of it all the information is useless. It is not about perfect note taking system - it is about the system which allows to keep your ideas moving - linking them together and be able to take advantage of them whenever you can.\n\n[(71) How to Organise your Life - Building a Second Brain - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ssUVyfn5g) #todo/watch\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T16:41:37.272428872Z","tags":null},"/ABOUT/DISC":{"title":"DISC","content":"# DISC\n## My test results: ![[ATTACHMENTS/DISC Paweł Lipowczan.pdf]]\n\n## What to focus on:\n- [ ] Be more active in discussions - show that you have a lot to tell and your knowledge is deep and wide.\n- [ ] If someone criticize you don't forget to develop the subject and ask for feedback.\n- [ ] Force myself to say more what I have to say, because if they don't know they cannot do anything about it.\n- [ ] Speak about your feelings and emotions more.\n- [ ] Focus what is important to me and what are my needs.\n\n## Resources\n[[KNOWLEDGES/DISC]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T16:41:37.272428872Z","tags":null},"/ABOUT/HABITS/Habits":{"title":"Habits","content":"# Habits\n## Aktualnie\n### Rano (6:20):\n1.

Bedding the bed - with this habit we complete the first task of the day which gives us a boost of dopamine and a positive mood for the next tasks.  \n\t- Clean surroundings, order works well for us.  \n\t- We start the day with success - this gives us good energy for the rest of the day  \n2. Drinking water - lots of water - we get dehydrated while we sleep and therefore it is good to replenish water in the morning  \n3. Brushing teeth  \n\t- I habitually drink water with lemon in the morning and such can damage tooth enamel  \n\t- I brush my teeth with my left hand, i.e. not my dominant hand, which I usually do - this creates new neural connections in the brain  \n4. Breathing exercises - I am currently practicing Wim Hof's breathing exercises.  \n\t- The brain is about 2% of our body, but it uses 20% of all the body's resources, so it's good to \"oxygenate\" ourselves.  \n\t- Oxygen helps fight pathogens and helps the immune system work against them.  \n5. Diary - to increase your brain power you can take notes, plan your day, write down your thoughts. Additionally, it is important to write down what you are grateful for. The brain thrives on gratitude. If you are not grateful for what you already have it will be difficult to devote yourself to something you want. To feel gratitude immediately, just list all the things you have that money can't buy. There is an article in times about people who live 80/90. According to the article, their longevity is influenced by the fact that they are grateful, they practice gratitude. The second aspect is that these people are lifelong learners. Further, many geniuses write diaries. Einstein, Marie Skłodowka Curie, Leonardo Da Vinci and others. They probably didn't keep diaries because they were geniuses but conversely they were geniuses because they did.  \n6. Exercise - intense interval training or tabata (about 10 minutes) - exercise is good for the heart and usually if something is good for the heart it is also good for the brain. Besides, exercise helps oxygenate the brain by increasing the heart rate. \n\nOwn work - work on yourself, own/internal projects\nLearning (10 min)  \nReading (10 min)  \nAffirmations (5 min)  \nTask planning (10 min)  \nReading (10 min)  \nSelf-work (tasks) (30 min)  \nReading + Pocket (10 min)  \nSupplements: curcumin, creatine, Ashwagandha (standardized extract), Bacopa Monnieri, acetylholine (alpha gpc) cdp holin + omega3  \nThyroid tea  \nAloe vera  \nSupplements  \nBrain cocktail - water, chocolate, almond milk (blueberries, avocado, eggs are also good)  \nRecorded by Rafal Mazur  \nFamily habits: what do couples who are happy with each other do? 8 daily habits to implement right away  [Co robią pary, które są ze sobą szczęśliwe? 8 codziennych nawyków do wprowadzenia od zaraz (edziecko.pl)](https://www.edziecko.pl/rodzice/56,79318,21176545,co-robia-pary-ktore-sa-ze-soba-szczesliwe-8-codziennych-nawykow.html?utm_source=facebook.com\u0026utm_medium=SM\u0026utm_campaign=FB_Kobieta)\nThinking about your dreams - what dreams we had - often in our sleep we think about what happened during the day.

Avoid constant pressure that you need more, that there is something you can do. [[BOOK/Company of one]] #reading-list/business-finance \n3. Enjoy it all - do it for fun (business and life). Enjoy the process and not only when you achieve something. Goal alternative:\n\t1. Values - what values you follow in life - write it down and stick to it and all decisions you make confront with those values.\n\t2. Direction - instead of defining a goal you can define a direction - you will avoid the pressure of not reaching the destination when you won't achieve the goal, if only you will go in the direction you defined you will be able to get somewhere and enjoy the process.\n\t3. Boundaries - to keep the right direction you have to move in the specified boundaries for example - don't drink alcohol because it makes bad impact on your productivity and health, sleep well - long and good quality etc.\n\t4. Rhythm - find your onw rhythm in which you work and live for example work in the morning or in the night - the time when you are more productive, work in batches - for 3 months very intensive and then 1 month free of work.\n\n## 5 methods of actions:\n1. Extend your working day to 48 hours - in order to do so you need a team, delegate all your work that you don't need to be involved in. Having someone else do the job and implement automations will allow you to create time space for yourself where you can focus only on yourself and develop/elaborate on your thoughts.\n2.  Email marketing works - start building the email list around yourself. You would be able to use it in the future to sell something. However you need to know how to do it correctly.\n3. I'm not relevant - the most important is the client. You need to develop your empathy to be able to step into another person's shoes and find and fulfill the client needs. [[BOOKS/W sercu emocji dziecka]] [[BOOKS/Twoje kompetentne dziecko]] You need to be able to feel your client emotions - this empathy is all about.\n4. Only practice - stop taking courses, stop reading, start doing.\n5. Errors are OK - you will make a lot of mistakes. But if you do something you gain either the money or the experience - if you do something wrong the important thing is to learn on your mistake and adjust \n\nYou have to be yourself.

I learned the most in practice while working on projects. You just must start working. If no one wants to hire a person without experience, then either they have too high a rate or they are not looking in the right place. If you need help with this, then there is a suggestion for you at the end of this article.\n2.  I \"wasted\" most of my time in college. You don't need college to become a programmer and to get a job in this profession. However, you can get valuable relationships and build relationships while studying.\n3.  It is good to know something about everything and everything about something. Broad knowledge gives you a better picture and suggests more options from which to choose the best solution.\n4.  The best sources of knowledge are specialized courses and team members. Surrounding yourself with people smarter than yourself is a good way to grow. In addition, it is good to be part of a community organized around our interests.\n5.  It is good to build your personal brand and portfolio from the beginning. This will make us stand out in the crowd and thus it will be easier to get our dream job or be involved in an interesting project and negotiate better rates. Let others found you on the web and interesting projects and people will apply to you themselves.\n\n## Why programming in the first place?\n\nOne of the best things for me about being a programmer is that you never stop learning. Even after years of experience, there is always something new to learn. In my Gallup test results, it came out that I ranked \"learning\" second in talents - one of the reasons I like this environment so much.\n\nMicrosoft .NET is a great platform for software development. - I started my career as a programmer using the C# language and the .NET platform. I've never looked back - the .NET platform is extremely versatile and provides everything you need to develop high-quality applications of all types from mobile applications to desktop applications to web applications.\n\nProgramming is an art form. If done well, code can be beautiful and elegant - much like poetry or music. \n\nBeing a programmer is not just about writing code. It's about understanding the problem you want to solve and finding the best way to solve it. It's also about having an in-depth knowledge of the tools you use and knowing how to use them effectively. And finally, it's about being able to work with other people to get the best results.\n\nFinally, programming gives a lot of satisfaction. There's nothing better than seeing the results of your work - how your programs work and make others' lives easier.\n\n## My story\n\nMy professional programming adventure began in the fourth year of college. I remember it like today - one of my friends during the vacations started working in one of the software development companies (such a current software house). I spent those vacations in the USA and he wrote to me that they needed someone else. I agreed to an interview and shortly after my return I started working as a junior .NET programmer. Due to my still ongoing studies, the working hours were irregular and unlimited. I worked as much as I could - I usually went straight to the company after class. Even then I paid attention to several aspects:\n\n1.  I knew nothing - much of the time I had no idea what to do.\n2.  There is nothing better than a good and helpful team.\n3.  Programming is something for me - the satisfaction of completing projects is a great feeling.\n4.  Unstructured and unlimited working hours suit me.\n\nThe reason I am writing about this is that it is a good idea to look for your first job already in college and explore what options are available and if this is what you would like to do. Going to college I didn't yet know what I would do professionally. I think most people at this stage are still fuzzy-headed and don't have a clear idea of what they want to do in life. That was the case with me. The only thing I knew was that I like to spend time in front of a computer, and that's what guided me when I chose to study computer science. 😉In hindsight and given my current experience then, as far as programming is concerned, college is not a good path. On the other hand, I don't regret anything, because I have this feeling that all the events that took place in my life led me to where I am and I'm fine with that. Coming back to studies it can be seen as a kind of extension of childhood. 🎮 Unfortunately, once you start working you end a certain stage where your only duty is to study, and a period begins when you must take responsibility not only for yourself, but also for others.\n\nGoing back to college, the most important thing you can get out of it is relationships, and if I had to choose one thing, I would take from college it would be relationships with peers, which many times gave more value than knowledge. Also, when it comes to college material, especially when it comes to computer science, it didn't keep up with technology. C# was already a fairly mature programming language and little attention was paid to it in college. It was the same with Java. In contrast, a lot of attention was focused on archaic languages such as PASCAL, C, Assembler. Overall, there was too much theory and not enough practice, and perhaps path profiling should have come earlier than the fourth year.\n\nTo find a job in IT, studies are not needed. I have never been asked by anyone for a degree, and I have changed employers many times. It's because the market for programmers is an employee's market, but I the main reason is that studies don't prepare you for a job anyway and are no indicator of your knowledge and capabilities. What appeals to recruiters much better is the training and certifications you have received and the projects you have completed. So, it's worth focusing on building your personal brand and your portfolio from the beginning.\n\nIt's also a good idea to have a profile on LinkedIn, where you can upload important information. Often a good profile is more important than a resume. There is much more information there than just our skills and experience. From the profile you can also read what kind of person we are and whether we have the right mentality - we have the right values and whether our character will fit with the organization looking for a candidate. Nowadays, I see more often the option \"Apply via LinkedIn\" on job offers.\n\nA more advanced topic is the website, which is very important in the process of building a personal brand. It demonstrates a greater maturity and awareness of the owner and his greater commitment. The website itself is also a business card and a project itself. It testifies to your ability to realize the design of your own site. Certainly, candidates with a website stand out because there are few of them.\n\nAn extremely important aspect I still wanted to draw attention to is people. It is said a lot that the most important thing is people, and there is a lot of truth in that. From them you can learn the most, especially from those smarter than yourself. In this connection, a saying has stuck with me that if you are the smartest person in the room, it means you are in the wrong room. Very apt in my opinion. A person learns all his life and can learn the most from people smarter than himself. Moreover, it is also very apt to say that we are the sum of the five people closest to us. So if we surround ourselves with people who pull us upward then we will grow and develop.\n\nLast but not least lesson I learned would be that time is very important. It is our most important resource. That's why I respect and am very grateful if someone takes the time to do something for me or participate in a meeting I organize. I try to give the other party as much value as possible in return for the time spent. At the same time, I do not tolerate wasting my time. I avoid all kinds of meetings in which I cannot give value or which do not give value to me. We have limited time in the day, and I believe that managing it skillfully is the way to happiness and fulfillment.\n\n# Resources\nThis article is published also here: [MY CAREER PATH - Pawel Lipowczan](https://pawel.lipowczan.pl/my-career-path/)","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T16:41:37.272428872Z","tags":null},"/ABOUT/Principles":{"title":"Principles","content":"# Principles\n\n1.

It describes the slip-box technique and describe who invented it and how it worked for him. Approach to note-taking was inspired by the 20th-century German sociologist Niklas Luhmann.\n# 🎨 Impressions\n\n## How I Discovered It\n\nI explored [[KNOWLEDGES/Zettelkasten]] concept and in one article on the Internet this book was mentioned.\n\n## Who Should Read It?\n\nEveryone who would like to make good notes and take advantage of them in the efficient way.\n\n# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me\n\nThis was the \"why\" for taking notes while reading and looking for the purpose of reading and learning specified stuff. The important thing for me was finding the purpose of note taking - it is not just collecting information; it is seeking to develop ideas and arguments. I try to read with a pen in my hand - I always did but now I know that it makes sense.\n\n# Summary + Notes\n\nSystematically make three types of notes to develop your ideas and arguments:\n1. Fleeting notes - they don’t go in a slip-box; they’re simply for capturing ideas and thoughts. You can take them in a notebook, on a scrap of paper, or wherever works for you. Keep these notes in one place so you can go through them later.\n2. Literature notes - notes about what you read. While you’re reading, write down things you don’t want to forget along with reference details. Your notes should be short and in your own words. These go into your reference slip-box– the first of the two slip-boxes.\n3. Permanent notes - These will arise from your fleeting and literature notes, which you should go through regularly– preferably daily. As you review your notes, ask yourself what’s relevant to your own ideas, your research, and your interests. Remember that you’re not just collecting information; you’re seeking to develop your ideas and arguments. Ask how the information you’re recording adds to your existing notes. Does it contradict, correct, or support them? Do new ideas come to mind? Do any new questions arise?\n\nOne permanent note per idea. Don't copy, create something new - precise and concise and include sources\n\nFile permanent notes in slip-box and make references to other notes.\n\nIndex - tag notes and place them in index - keywords with a link to an entry point to particular subjects in your.\n\nBrain capability: it is “a machine for jumping to conclusions”– it has a habit of filling in gaps and making connections and patterns that simply aren’t there. By writing, you externalize your thinking process. And this allows you to see facts and rationalize your thoughts more clearly.\n\nRead with a pen and paper in your hand #hint\n\nPearl of wisdom from Benjamin Franklin: read with a pen in hand. And, while reading, “enter in a little book short hints of what you feel that is common or that may be useful.”\n\nWith a slip-box, the reason for your reading and note-taking is perfectly clear: to build on your previous notes and arguments.\n\nConfirmation bias - don't try to confirm what you already know. #hint\n\nFor who you are taking notes (for yourself in the future) - you’re doing so for someone who may have general knowledge in the field, but perhaps doesn’t know the specifics and the original context.\n\nElaboration - looking for connections with what you already know. Your slip-box enhances elaboration. It is when you think about the meaning of what you're reading and how it relates to your own thoughts, ideas, and arguments.\n\nMake smart notes part of your reading routine. #hint\n\nRead with a clear purpose or goal in mind #hint \n\n## Summary\nNiklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten, or slip-box, is an innovative way to externalize your thoughts and build up a reservoir of ideas, arguments, and information. Used correctly, it’ll become like a conversation partner and will ultimately make it easier for you to write academic papers, think more clearly, and improve both your long-term learning and understanding.","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T16:41:37.392429277Z","tags":null},"/BOOKS/Millionaire-Fastlane":{"title":"Millionaire Fastlane","content":"\n# Millionaire Fastlane\n\nDate Finished: Sep 0, 2022\nAuthor:\nTags:\n\n---\n#todo/complete \n# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\n\n# 🎨 Impressions\n\n## How I Discovered It\n\n## Who Should Read It?\n\n# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me\n\nHow my life / behavior / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.\n\n# ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes\n\n# 📒 Summary + Notes","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T16:41:37.392429277Z","tags":null},"/BOOKS/Miracle-morning":{"title":"Miracle morning","content":"\n# Miracle morning\n\nDate Finished: 5th February 2018\nAuthor: Hal Elrod\n\n---\n# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences\nDiscover the miracle of getting up early and.

For about a year I got up early and did my morning routine. The main reason why I changed the waking hour was that I struggled with getting to bed early enough to maintain about 8 hours sleep. I had also some health issues. Nevertheless I moved getting up from 5:00 to 6:20, and since about 2 years it works for me. I developed most of my habits based on this book: [[ABOUT/HABITS/Habits]]\n# 📒 Summary + Notes\n### The elements of what should a great morning contain:\n1. Silence\n2. Reading\n3. Affirmations\n4.

Lack of responsibility - one must be responsible to someone for an action or its consequences because it forces action. Duty is something we sometimes don't like but we have to do no matter what.  \n5. Try to get a co-responsible partner - someone who will support and hold you accountable in the pursuit of established have goals  \n6. Club of mediocrities - with what you become, so you become.  \n\t- You can join some online community such as Meetup  \n\t- Join an online business and marketing group www.bni.com\n7.

It turned out to be an effective way to take notes and organize information. This system allows you to quickly identify and record key information. It also provides a way to review and recall information later.\n\nIt is based on the simple principles:\n\nDivide notes page into 4 sections:\n1. Title section (optional)\n2. Keywords/comments/questions section (30% width)\n3. Notes section (70% width)\n4. Summary section\n\nLike this:\n![[ATTACHMENTS/Pasted image 20220821205449.png]]\n\nAs you listen to a lecture or read a chapter, record the main ideas in the \"Notes\" section. Then, write down key details and your thoughts in the \"Keywords/comments/questions\" section.\n\nWhen you're finished taking notes, review each section and highlight important points. Then, create a summary of your notes by writing a brief overview of the main ideas in the \"Summary\" section.\n\n# Why Should You Use Cornell Notes?\n\nBesides being a very efficient way of taking great notes in class, Cornell note taking is THE perfect tip for exam preparation. Here’s why:\n\nThe system itself encourages you to reflect on your notes by actively summarizing them in their own words. Often, this can already be enough to remember study notes and to successfully pass an exam.\n\nWhen reviewing your notes it’s also useful to reorder objects on the page, for example, to add a solution to an answer on the side to the notes.\n\nYT:\n[How to Take Cornell Notes (with examples) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcWfXWM4kco)","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T16:41:37.396429291Z","tags":null},"/KNOWLEDGES/DISC":{"title":"DISC","content":"\n# DISC\nIt has been known for a long time that the success of a company consists of many factors, including a team that is selected and motivated to work.

Get out of your comfort zone. Writing technical articles make you understand the topic better and exposes you to the evaluation of others and a different perspective by which if someone refers to the text there is a good chance that they will complete it. Besides, sharing knowledge is a great feeling.\n\nProgramming gives you freedom because you can write code everywhere - all you need is notebook and a bit of space where you can focus. However if you end up in company where you have to work on site and in specified hours it is not possible so you need to find company with a remote ethics. Moreover you cannot be fully free in some cases when you are asked to code boring things - the same things over and over again - you gain no experience by doing so or you are building something that you don't agree with or don't understand. One more important thing - for some people - including me the most important thing is to see the code in action and when you code a big system it is hard to achieve that since you need a long time to create working version and your part is so small that you won't be able to easily notice your part. That is the reason I turned in some part into nocode and automation since you can gain this feeling easier and see your effort pay off much faster.\n\nThe society broadens your perspective and right people gives you good hints and great ideas. \n\nWhen you look backwards you notice that all the dots form a straight line and when you look ahead you notice that there are so many dots and it is all a mess ( #todo/check Steve Jobs?).\n\nYou need to be in the right place in the right time but the most important thing is that you need to be prepared for that. However the opportunities are like busses. When one is gone there will \"always\" be another one - hate that word \"always\" because you cannot be certain so more appropriate would be writing \"there is a high probability\". Sometimes the problem is that there are too many opportunities and then you need to learn how to say \"no\" and pick the right one - pareto 20/80 - find the 20 percent which gives you 80 percent of results. [[KNOWLEDGE\\Pareto]]\n\nThere is one thing that is worth doing ... \"doing\" - whatever it is just do it (nike ;) - you most likely fail but you will learn on the way so you either gain experience or cash [[ABOUT/I have a business and not business has me]].\n\nOne of the most important thing in running a business is to create an appropriate team. Finding a good person for the right position is very hard, and the costs of hiring the wrong employee are very high. So it occurs that the old Russian proverb is very true: \"Trust, but verify\" [Trust, but verify - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify). \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T16:41:37.396429291Z","tags":null},"/PROJECTS/SHAREFUND/ShareFund":{"title":"ShareFund","content":"# ShareFund\n\n## Description\nA tool that helps in distributing shares in a non incorporated startup.

# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Knowledge Base Template** are documented here, for people
who have cloned the template and want to pull improvements into their own base.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Dates are ISO (UTC).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **`brain-reindex` no longer destroys the `## Recent Changes` section.**
  `scripts/build_indexes.py` regenerated that section from "the 15 newest notes by
  `date:`" with a 75-character `summary:` snippet. But Recent Changes is a hand-maintained
  *change log* — "what changed and why" — which no frontmatter field records, so every
  rebuild silently replaced curated narrative with a derived listing. The script now
  preserves an existing `## Recent Changes` section verbatim and only falls back to the
  derived listing when the section is absent (fresh vault); the fallback also now emits 10
  entries, matching the "last 10 changes" contract in `AGENTS.md` instead of 15.

  If you run the scheduled `kb-maintain` workflow, this was also making **every** run
  report a substantive index diff and open a no-op PR whose only effect was clobbering
  that section. After this fix a clean vault reproduces all three indexes exactly
  (0 substantive diff), so the workflow opens a PR only on genuine drift.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: all workflow commands and skills are namespaced** — command wrappers moved
  from `.claude/commands/*.md` to `.claude/commands/b/*.md` (subdirectory = native `:`
  namespace, so `/ingest` is now `/b:ingest`), and every vault skill directory gained a
  `brain-` prefix with its frontmatter `name:` updated to match (`ingest` → `brain-ingest`).
  This stops collisions with same-named skills from installed plugins and groups the
  vault's commands in the slash menu. Skill **descriptions are unchanged**, so
  natural-language triggering ("process inbox", "health check") works exactly as before.
  The research suite also gained command wrappers (`/b:research`, `/b:research-deep`,
  `/b:research-report`, `/b:research-add-items`, `/b:research-add-fields`) — previously
  it was invocable only by bare skill name. `excalidraw-diagram` (generic utility) keeps
  its name. All cross-references in skills, scripts, docs, and the test suite's
  path constants (`tests/run_tests.py`) updated.

  | Old command | New command | Old skill | New skill |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `/onboard` | `/b:onboard` | `onboard` | `brain-onboard` |
  | `/ingest` | `/b:ingest` | `ingest` | `brain-ingest` |
  | `/compile` | `/b:compile` | `compile` | `brain-compile` |
  | `/enhance` | `/b:enhance` | `enhance` | `brain-enhance` |
  | `/reindex` | `/b:reindex` | `reindex` | `brain-reindex` |
  | `/qa` | `/b:qa` | `qa` | `brain-qa` |
  | `/lint` | `/b:lint` | `lint` | `brain-lint` |
  | `/output` | `/b:output` | `output` | `brain-output` |
  | `/refactor` | `/b:refactor` | `refactor` | `brain-refactor` |
  | `/gaps` | `/b:gaps` | `gaps` | `brain-gaps` |
  | `/curate` | `/b:curate` | `curate` | `brain-curate` |
  | `/export` | `/b:export` | `export` | `brain-export` |
  | `/import` | `/b:import` | `import` | `brain-import` |
  | — | `/b:research` | `research` | `brain-research` |
  | — | `/b:research-deep` | `research-deep` | `brain-research-deep` |
  | — | `/b:research-report` | `research-report` | `brain-research-report` |
  | — | `/b:research-add-items` | `research-add-items` | `brain-research-add-items` |
  | — | `/b:research-add-fields` | `research-add-fields` | `brain-research-add-fields` |

  Existing bases: `git mv` your `.claude/commands/*.md` into `.claude/commands/b/`,
  `git mv` each skill dir to its `brain-*` name, update each `SKILL.md` `name:` field
  to match the new directory name, then re-pull the updated docs (README, AGENTS
  template, REFERENCE notes). Muscle-memory note: type `/b:` and tab-complete.

### Fixed
- **`/research-deep` JSON validator was a silent no-op** —
  `.claude/skills/research/validate_json.py` only read the `field_categories:` /
  `category:` schema, but `/research` Step 4 emits `fields.yaml` with `categories:` /
  `name:`. On that schema the loader parsed **0 fields** and every file "passed"
  trivially (100% of nothing). The loader now accepts **both** schema styles
  (`field_categories`|`categories`, category label `category`|`name`). Second fix:
  `valid` gated only on `required` fields, and nothing was ever marked `required`, so
  even a correctly-parsed schema passed with fields missing — when a schema marks
  nothing required the validator now **treats all defined fields as required and
  enforces full coverage** (a file missing any field FAILs with exit 1). Backward
  compatible: schemas that set explicit `required:` flags keep the original gating.
  Existing bases: re-pull `.claude/skills/research/validate_json.py`.

### Changed
- **`web-search-agent` no longer hard-depends on a Unix `date` call** — step 0 ("Get
  Current Date") ran `date +%Y-%m-%d`, which errors in a PowerShell-only environment
  (`date` is a `Get-Date` alias that rejects `+%Y-%m-%d`). It now takes today's date from
  the harness-injected context (no shell call), and only falls back to a tool call —
  Bash `date +%Y-%m-%d` or PowerShell `Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd` — if the date is
  genuinely unavailable. Shell-agnostic; the failure was cosmetic (date is only used to
  filter "recent" results) but this removes it. Existing bases: re-pull
  `.claude/agents/web-search-agent.md`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-13

First tagged release of the second-brain template.

### Fixed
- **`/lint` link scanner no longer false-flags escaped-pipe aliases** —
  `.claude/skills/lint/scripts/lint_links.py` split link targets on `|` but not on the
  table-escaped `\|`, so `[[Note\|alias]]` resolved to `Note\` and was reported broken.
  Now normalizes `\|`→`|` before splitting. Also treats `.webp` as an asset embed (was
  flagged broken). Cut ~7 false positives on a ~360-note vault. The lint `SKILL.md` now
  points at the two canonical scanners (`lint_scan.py`, `lint_links.py`) so runs use them
  instead of ad-hoc greps, and reminds the operator to triage raw broken-link counts.
  Existing bases: re-pull `.claude/skills/lint/`.

### Changed
- **`/qa` cites chat answers as percent-encoded markdown links** — instead of
  `[[wikilinks]]`, the Q&A skill now emits `[Title](content/…%20path.md)` links that are
  clickable in Claude Desktop and VS Code markdown preview (saved answer-notes still use
  `[[wikilinks]]` for Obsidian/graph). Existing bases: re-pull `.claude/skills/qa/`.

### Added
- **YT ingest supports an alternate yt-dlp `player_client`** — `ingest/scripts/yt_fetch.py`
  now threads an optional `player_client` through metadata + caption fetching
  (`--extractor-args youtube:player_client=…`), a workaround for when the default client is
  throttled or blocked. Existing bases: re-pull `.claude/skills/ingest/scripts/`.
- **Research skill suite now ships its `web-search-agent` dependency** — the `/research`
  → `/research-deep` → `/research-report` pipeline dispatches a `web-search-agent`
  sub-agent that was never bundled, so the deep phase silently fell back to generic web
  search. Added `.claude/agents/web-search-agent.md` + `.claude/agents/web-search-modules/`
  (5 routing modules: general-web, github-debug, stackoverflow, academic-papers,
  chinese-tech), vendored from the upstream **Weizhena/Deep-Research-skills** (MIT) this
  suite was adapted from. Also fixed two hardcoded home-dir paths that assumed a global
  `~/.claude` install: `research-deep` now runs
  `python .claude/skills/research/validate_json.py` (was `~/.claude/skills/…`) and the
  agent loads modules from `.claude/agents/web-search-modules/` (was `~/.claude/agents/…`)
  — both project-relative so a cloned template works without a global install. Removed a
  machine-specific project-root path from `research/SKILL.md` (now "the vault/project
  root"). Existing bases: pull `.claude/agents/` and re-pull `.claude/skills/research-deep/`
  + `.claude/skills/research/`.
- **Export privacy levels: `/export --public` redaction pipeline** — bundles that leave
  your trust boundary (shared with strangers, published openly) can now be scrubbed of
  private data. Default level stays exactly as before (verbatim, 2 prompts, read-only).
  `--public` adds: a category redaction policy (always cut secrets, third-party PII,
  health, finance, rates; genericize personal/commercial context; keep tools/howtos/
  technical opinions) tunable per vault via a new optional `content/_privacy.md`
  (commented example ships with the template); one approvable verdict table
  (include/redact/exclude per note, full diff on demand — 3rd and normally last prompt);
  two post-redaction safety nets (`privacy_sweep.py` deterministic pattern scan for
  emails/phones/IBAN/cards/API-keys/JWT/wallets + a fresh-context adversarial LLM audit);
  wikilink de-personalization (`[[My Crypto Strategy]]` → `[[Crypto Strategy]]`, person-name
  titles genericized) — and writes a local redaction report to `_outputs/reports/`.
  The shipped bundle deliberately carries **no redaction trace** (manifest unchanged,
  format still 1) — the local report is the only record. Also fixes `bundle.py` exclusion:
  underscore-prefixed **files** (e.g. `_privacy.md`) can no longer be packed at any level.
  Existing bases: pull `.claude/skills/export/` (SKILL.md + `bundle.py` +
  `privacy_sweep.py` + tests) and optionally `content/_privacy.md`.
- **Note-bundle transfer: `/export` + `/import` skills** — move sets of notes between
  any two template-based knowledge bases. `/export` (new skill + command) resolves a
  selection (wikilink list, `#tag`, or folder), confirms it, offers depth-1 linked
  neighbors, and packs verbatim note copies into a `brain-pack-*.zip` with a
  `manifest.json` (format `1`, source base name, export date, per-note sha256) — fully
  read-only for the vault. `/import` (new skill + command) validates the bundle before
  any write (format/hash checks), auto-skips byte-identical notes (idempotent re-import),
  triages collisions in a single approve-or-edit table (skip/merge/keep-target/rename),
  maps notes from missing source folders onto the target vault's own taxonomy in a second
  single table (never seeds foreign folder structures unasked), stamps
  `imported-from`/`imported` provenance frontmatter, leaves broken wikilinks intact for
  later re-stitching, batch-updates all 3 indexes, and writes a report to
  `_outputs/reports/` — hard budget of at most 2 user prompts per run, regardless of
  bundle size. Deterministic mechanics live in `export/scripts/bundle.py`
  (`pack`/`unpack`/`same`, stdlib-only Python, tests included). Existing bases: pull
  `.claude/skills/export/`, `.claude/skills/import/`, `.claude/commands/export.md`,
  `.claude/commands/import.md`, and add the two Workflows rows to your `AGENTS.md`.
- **"Works beyond Claude Code" docs** — the template now documents that it runs *outside*
  Claude Code, with **no terminal and no git commands**. Three doc-only additions: a new
  README section listing the supported tools (Claude Desktop Code tab, GitHub Copilot,
  Codex, Cursor, Antigravity) and how to run commands / save changes in each; a note in
  `AGENTS.template.md` explaining which tool reads `AGENTS.md` vs `CLAUDE.md` and why the
  `@AGENTS.md` import keeps one source of truth; and a new **`ENVIRONMENTS.md`** carrying
  the full verified tool-by-tool matrix (file access, native vs conversational commands,
  git-without-commands, which instruction file each tool reads). No skill or
  generation-logic changes. Existing bases: pull `ENVIRONMENTS.md` and add the
  README / `AGENTS.md` paragraphs if you want the same guidance (your rendered `AGENTS.md`
  predates the note — paste it in by hand).
- **`LICENSE` (MIT)** — the template now ships an explicit MIT license, so forks have
  real permission to use, modify, and redistribute it. Without a license file a public
  repo defaults to "all rights reserved," which silently contradicted the "git clone and
  it's yours" invitation. Also adds a **License** section to the README. Existing bases:
  pull `LICENSE` if you intend to republish or share your clone.
- **Scheduled maintenance workflow** (`.github/workflows/kb-maintain.yml`) — an optional
  GitHub Action that keeps navigation fresh without anyone remembering to run `/reindex`.
  Weekly (and on-demand via the Actions tab) it rebuilds `content/_indexes/` and runs the
  lint scanner, then opens **one** pull request only if the rebuild changed the indexes in
  substance — a restamped `updated:` timestamp alone never triggers a PR. It never edits
  your notes; the only writes are to `_indexes/`, via a PR you review. Encodes OpenWiki's
  "doc drift is a CI problem, not a discipline problem" idea. Delete the file to opt out.
  - **Enable it:** it runs automatically once the file is on your default branch. Under
    **Settings → Actions → General**, allow workflows to *"Read and write"* and to
    *"create and approve pull requests"* so the bot can open the maintenance PR.
- **`/curate` skill** — vault hygiene: scores notes for staleness, isolation, dead links,
  and duplication; proposes archive/merge/refresh; retires confirmed notes to
  `content/_graveyard/` (reversible — never `git rm`, gated on your confirmation).
- **`content/_graveyard/`** — holding folder for retired notes, excluded from the indexes.
- **This `CHANGELOG.md`** — from now on every template change is recorded here.

### Changed
- **Single source of truth for agent instructions.** `AGENTS.md` is now the canonical
  file that holds all project instructions (role, navigation protocol, writing style,
  frontmatter, workflows, safety). `CLAUDE.md` is reduced to a thin pointer that imports
  `AGENTS.md` via the `@AGENTS.md` line, so Claude Code and any `AGENTS.md`-reading agent
  (Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode) all follow **one** file. Previously the content lived in
  `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` was a short mirror — the two could drift.
  - **Migration (existing bases):** move your instruction body from `CLAUDE.md` into
    `AGENTS.md`, then replace `CLAUDE.md` with a pointer whose last line is `@AGENTS.md`.
    Fresh clones get this automatically from the updated templates via `/onboard`.
  - `onboard` still renders and personalizes both files; no action needed for new setups.
- **README** — clearer positioning: the base as an LLM Wiki (Karpathy) that is portable
  via the OKF standard, with the index-first "why it scales without embeddings" explainer.

### Fixed
- **Non-Latin vaults** — forced UTF-8 stdout so `/lint`, `/gaps`, and `/refactor` no longer
  crash on non-ASCII content (e.g. Polish); `build_indexes.py` writes UTF-8 too.
- **`/lint` false positives** — `lint_scan` now parses block-style YAML tag lists, so notes
  using multi-line `tags:` no longer report a spurious `missing_tags`.

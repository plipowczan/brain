# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Knowledge Base Template** are documented here, for people
who have cloned the template and want to pull improvements into their own base.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Dates are ISO (UTC).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Single source of truth for agent instructions.** `AGENTS.md` is now the canonical
  file that holds all project instructions (role, navigation protocol, writing style,
  frontmatter, workflows, safety). `CLAUDE.md` is reduced to a thin pointer that imports
  `AGENTS.md` via the `@AGENTS.md` line, so Claude Code and any `AGENTS.md`-reading agent
  (Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode) all follow **one** file. Previously the content lived in
  `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` was a short mirror — the two could drift.
  - **Migration (existing bases):** move your instruction body from `CLAUDE.md` into
    `AGENTS.md`, then replace `CLAUDE.md` with a pointer whose last line is `@AGENTS.md`.
    Fresh clones get this automatically from the updated templates via `/onboard`.
  - `onboard` still renders and personalizes both files; no action needed for new setups.
